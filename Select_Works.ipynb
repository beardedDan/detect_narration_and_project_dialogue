camp on the yukon to labour and to be content with that a man hath is a sweet life but he that findeth a treasure is above them both \" ecclesiasticus of course they were bound for the klondyke every creature in the north west was bound for the klondyke men from the south too and men from the east had left their ploughs and their pens their factories pulpits and easy chairs each man like a magnetic needle suddenly set free and turning sharply to the north all set pointing the self same way since that july day in when the excelsior sailed into san francisco harbour bringing from the uttermost regions at the top of the map close upon a million dollars in nuggets and in gold dust some distance this side of the arctic circle on the right bank of the yukon a little detachment of that great army pressing northward had been wrecked early in the month of september they had realised on leaving the ocean going ship that landed them at st michael s island near the mouth of the great river that they could not hope to reach dawson that year but instead of \"getting cold feet as the phrase for discouragement ran and turning back as thousands did or putting in the winter on the coast they determined with an eye to the spring rush to cover as many as possible of the seventeen hundred miles of waterway before navigation closed they knew in a vague way that winter would come early but they had not counted on the big september storm that dashed their heavy laden boats against the floe ice ultimately drove them ashore and nearly cost the little party their lives on that last day of the long struggle up the stream a stiff north easter was cutting the middle reach of the mighty river two miles wide here into a choppy and dangerous sea day by day five men in the two little boats had kept serious eyes on the shore then came the morning when out of the monotonous cold and snow flurries something new appeared a narrow white rim forming on the river margin the first ice winter beginning to show his teeth said one man with an effort at jocosity day by day nearer came the menace narrower and swifter still ran the deep black water strip between the encroaching ice lines but the thought that each day s sailing or rowing meant many days nearer the klondyke seemed to inspire a superhuman energy day by day each man had felt and no man yet had said we must camp to night for eight months \" they had looked landward shivered and held on their way but on this particular morning when they took in sail they realised it was to be that abomination of desolation on the shore or death and one or other speedily nearer the white teeth gleamed fiercer the gale swifter the current sweeping back the boats the mary c was left behind fighting for life while it seemed as if no human power could keep the tulare from being hurled against the western shore twice in spite of all they could do she was driven within a few feet of what looked like certain death with a huge effort that last time her little crew had just got her well in mid stream when a heavy roller breaking on the starboard side drenched the men and half filled the cockpit each rower still pulling for dear life with one hand bailed the boat with the other but for all their promptness a certain amount of the water froze solid before they could get it out great luck if we re going to take in water like this said the cheerful kentuckian shipping his oar and knocking off the ice \"great luck that all the stores are so well protected \" protected snapped out an anxious cast iron looking man at the rudder yes protected how s water to get through the ice coat that s over everything the cast iron steersman set his jaw grimly they seemed to be comparatively safe now with half a mile of open water between them and the western shore but they sat as before stiff alert each man in his ice jacket that cracked and crunched as he bent to his oar now right now left again they eyed the shore would it be could it be there they would have to land and if they did lord how it blew hard a port called out the steersman there just ahead was a great white capped \"roller\" coming coming the biggest wave they had encountered since leaving open sea but maccann the steersman swung the boat straight into the crested roller and the tulare took it gamely \"bow on \" all was going well when just in the boiling middle of what they had thought was foaming white cap the boat struck something solid shivered and went shooting down half under water recovered up again and seemed to pause in a second s doubt on the very top of the great wave in that second that seemed an eternity one man s courage snapped potts threw down his oar and swore by and by he wouldn t pull another stroke on the yukon while he was pouring out the words the steersman sprang from the tiller and seized potts oar just in time to save the boat from capsizing then he and the big kentuckian both turned on the distracted potts you infernal quitter shouted the steersman and choked with fury but even under the insult of that \"meanest word in the language potts sat glaring defiantly with his half frozen hands in his pockets it ain t a river anyhow this ain t he said it s plain simple hell and water \" the others had no time to realise that potts was clean out of his senses for the moment and the kentuckian still pulling like mad faced the \"quitter\" with a determination born of terror if you can t row take the rudder damnation take that rudder quick or we ll kill you and he half rose up never dropping his oar blindly potts obeyed the tulare was free now from the clinging mass at the bow but they knew they had struck their first floe farther on they could see other white caps bringing other ice masses down but there was no time for terrors ahead the gale was steadily driving them in shore again boat and oars alike were growing unwieldy with their coating of ever increasing ice and human strength was no match for the storm that was sweeping down from the pole lord how it blew there s a cove called out the kentuckian \"throw her in \" he shouted to potts sullenly the new steersman obeyed rolling in on a great surge the boat suddenly turned in a boiling eddy and the first thing anybody knew was that the tulare was on her side and her crew in the water potts was hanging on to the gunwale and damning the others for not helping him to save the boat she wasn t much of a boat when finally they got her into quiet water but the main thing was they had escaped with their lives and rescued a good proportion of their winter provisions all the while they were doing this last the kentuckian kept turning to look anxiously for any sign of the others in his heart bitterly blaming himself for having agreed to potts coming into the tulare that day in place of the kentuckian s own \"pardner \" when they had piled the rescued provisions up on the bank and just as they were covering the heap of bacon flour and bean bags boxes tools and utensils with a tarpaulin up went a shout and the two missing men appeared tramping along the ice encrusted shore where was the mary c well she was at the bottom of the yukon and her crew would like some supper they set up a tent and went to bed that first night extremely well pleased at being alive on any terms but people get over being glad about almost anything unless misfortune again puts an edge on the circumstance the next day not being in any immediate danger the boon of mere life seemed less satisfying in detachments they went up the river several miles and down about as far they looked in vain for any sign of the mary c they prospected the hills from the heights behind the camp they got a pretty fair idea of the surrounding country it was not reassuring as to products there seems to be plenty of undersized timber plenty of snow and plenty of river and as far as i can see just nothing else well there s oodles o blueberries said the boy his inky looking mouth bearing witness to veracity \"and there are black and red currants in the snow and rose apples \" oh yes returned the other \"it s a sort of garden of eden \" a little below here it was four miles from bank to bank of the main channel but at this point the river was only about two miles wide and white already with floating masses of floe ice going on a swift current down towards the sea four hundred miles away the right bank presented to the mighty river a low chain of hills fringed at the base with a scattered growth of scrubby spruce birch willow and cotton wood timber line was only two hundred feet above the river brink beyond that height rocks and moss covered with new fallen snow but if their side seemed cheerless what of the land on the left bank a swamp stretching endlessly on either hand and back from the icy flood as far as eye could see broken only by sloughs and an occasional ice rimmed tarn we ve been travelling just eight weeks to arrive at this said the kentuckian looking at the desolate scene with a homesick eye we re not only pretty far from home grumbled another \"we re still thirteen hundred miles away from the klondyke \" these unenlivening calculations were catching we re just about twenty five hundred miles from the nearest railroad or telegraph and now that winter s down on us exactly eight months from anywhere in the civilised world they had seen no sign of even savage life no white trader nothing to show that any human foot had ever passed that way before in that stillness that was like the stillness of death they went up the hillside with footsteps muffled in the clinging snow and sixty feet above the great river in a part of the wood where the timber was least unpromising they marked out a site for their winter quarters then this queer little company a denver bank clerk an ex schoolmaster from nova scotia an irish american lawyer from san francisco a kentucky \"colonel\" who had never smelt powder and \"the boy\" who was no boy at all but a man of twenty two these five set to work felling trees clearing away the snow and digging foundations for a couple of log cabins one for the trio as they called themselves the other for the colonel and the boy these two had chummed from the hour they met on the steamer that carried them through the golden gate of the pacific till well till the end of my story the colonel was a big tanned fellow nearly forty eldest of the party whom the others used to guy discreetly because you couldn t mention a place anywhere on the known globe except the far north which he had not personally inspected but for this foible as the untravelled considered it he was well liked and a little feared except by the boy who liked him \"first rate and feared him not at all they had promptly adopted each other before they discovered that it was necessary to have one or more pardners \" it seemed from all accounts to be true that up there at the top of the world a man alone is a man lost and ultimately the party was added to as aforesaid only two of them knew anything about roughing it jimmie o flynn of frisco the irish american lawyer had seen something of frontier life and fled it and maccann the nova scotian schoolmaster had spent a month in one of the caribou camps and on the strength of that proudly accepted the nickname of \"the miner \" colonel george warren and morris burnet the boy had the best outfits but this fact was held to be more than counter balanced by the value of the schoolmaster s experience at caribou and by the extraordinary handiness of potts the denver clerk who had helped to build the shelter on deck for the disabled sick on the voyage up this young man with the big mouth and lazy air had been in the office of a bank ever since he left school and yet under pressure he discovered a natural neat handedness and a manual dexterity justly envied by some of his fellow pioneers his outfit was not more conspicuously meagre than o flynn s yet the irishman was held to be the moneyed man of his party just why was never fully developed but it was always said o flynn represents capital and o flynn whether on that account or for a subtler and more efficient reason always got the best of everything that was going without money and without price on board ship o flynn with his ready tongue and his golden background \"representing capital\" was a leading spirit potts the handy man was a talker too and a good second but once in camp mac the miner was cock of the walk in those first days quoted \"caribou and ordered everybody about to everybody s satisfaction in a situation like this the strongest lean on the man who has ever seen anything like it\" before it was a comfort that anybody even thought he knew what to do under such new conditions so the others looked on with admiration and a pleasant confidence while mac boldly cut a hole in the brand new tent and instructed potts how to make a flange out of a tin plate with which to protect the canvas from the heat of the stove pipe no more cooking now in the bitter open everyone admired mac s foresight when he said we must build rock fireplaces in our cabins or we ll find our one little yukon stove burnt out before the winter is over before we have a chance to use it out prospecting and when mac said they must pool their stores the colonel and the boy agreed as readily as o flynn whose stores consisted of a little bacon some navy beans and a demijohn of whisky o flynn however urged that probably every man had a little \"mite o somethin \" that he had brought specially for himself somethin his friends had given him for instance there was potts now they all knew how the future mrs potts had brought a plum cake down to the steamer when she came to say good bye and made potts promise he wouldn t unseal the packet till christmas it wouldn t do to pool potts cake never there was the colonel the only man that had a sack of coffee he wouldn t listen when they had told him tea was the stuff up here and well perhaps other fellows didn t miss coffee as much as a kentuckian though he had heard never mind they wouldn t pool the coffee the boy had some preserved fruit that he seemed inclined to be a hog about oh look here i haven t touched it \"just what i m sayin you re hoardin that fruit \" it was known that mac had a very dacint little medicine chest of course if any fellow was ill mac wasn t the man to refuse him a little cold pizen but he must be allowed to keep his own medicine chest and that little pot o dundee marmalade as for o flynn he would look after the \"dimmi john \" but mac was dead against the whisky clause alcohol had been the curse of caribou and in this camp spirits were to be for medicinal purposes only whereon a cloud descended on mr o flynn and his health began to suffer but the precious demi john was put away \"in stock\" along with the single bottles belonging to the others mac had taken an inventory and no one in those early days dared touch anything without his permission they had cut into the mountain side for a level foundation and were hard at it now hauling logs i wonder said the boy stopping a moment in his work and looking at the bleak prospect round him \"i wonder if we re going to see anybody all winter \" oh sure to mac thought \"indians anyhow \" well i begin to wish they d mosy along said potts and the sociable o flynn backed him up it was towards noon on the sixth day after landing they had come to speak of this now as a voluntary affair when they were electrified by hearing strange voices looked up from their work and saw two white men seated on a big cake of ice going down the river with the current when they recovered sufficiently from their astonishment at the spectacle they ran down the hillside and proposed to help the castaways to land not a bit of it land in that place what you take us for not much we re going to st michael s they had a small boat drawn up by them on the ice and one man was dressed in magnificent furs a long sable overcoat and cap and wearing quite the air of a north pole nabob got any grub mac called out yes want some oh no i thought you you re not going to try to live through the winter there yes lord you are in a fix that s we thought about you but the travellers on the ice raft went by laughing and joking at the men safe on shore with their tents and provisions it made some of them visibly uneasy would they win through were they crazy to try it they had looked forward eagerly to the first encounter with their kind but this vision floating by on the treacherous ice of men who rather dared the current and the crash of contending floes than land where they were seemed of evil augury the little incident left a curiously sinister impression on the camp even mac was found agreeing with the others of his trio that since they had a grand tough time in front of them it was advisable to get through the black months ahead with as little wear and tear as possible in spite of the trio s superior talents they built a small ramshackle cabin with a tumble down fireplace which served them so ill that they ultimately spent all their waking hours in the more comfortable quarters of the colonel and the boy it had been agreed that these two with the help or at all events the advice of the others should build the bigger better cabin where the stores should be kept and the whole party should mess a cabin with a solid outside chimney of stone and an open fireplace generous of proportion and ancient of design \"just like down south \" the weather was growing steadily colder the ice was solid now many feet out from each bank of the river in the middle of the flood the clotted current still ran with floe ice but it was plain the river was settling down for its long sleep not silently not without stress and thunder the handful of dwellers on the shore would be waked in the night by the shock and crash of colliding floes the sound of the great winds rushing by and \"hush what s that \" tired men would start up out of sleep and sit straight to listen down below among the ice packs the noise as of an old time battle going on tumult and crashing and a boom boom like cannonading then one morning they woke to find all still the conflict over the yukon frozen from bank to bank no sound from that day on no more running water for a good seven months winter had come while the work went forward they often spoke of the only two people they had thus far seen both potts and o flynn had been heard to envy them mac had happened to say that he believed the fellow in furs was an englishman a canadian at the very least the americans chaffed him and said \"that accounts for it in a tone not intended to flatter mac hadn t thought of it before but he was prepared to swear now that if an englishman they were the hardiest pioneers on earth or a canadian was in favour of lighting out it must be for some good reason \" oh yes we all know that reason the americans laughed and mac growing hot was goaded into vaunting the britisher and running down the yankee yankee echoed the kentuckian \"and up in nova scotia they let this man teach school doesn t know the difference yet between the little corner they call new england and all the rest of america \" all the rest of america shouted mac \"the cheeky way you people of the states have of gobbling the continent in talk just as though the british part of it wasn t the bigger half \" yes but when you think which half you ought to be obliged to any fellow for forgetting it and then they referred to effete monarchical institutions and by the time they reached the question of the kind of king the prince of wales would make mac was hardly a safe man to argue with there was one bond between him and the kentucky colonel they were both religious men and although mac was blue presbyterian and an inveterate theologian somehow out here in the wilderness it was more possible to forgive a man for illusions about the apostolic succession and mistaken views upon church government the colonel at all events was not so lax but what he was ready to back up the calvinist in an endeavour to keep the sabbath with a careful compromise between church and chapel and help him to conduct a saturday night bible class but if the boy attended the bible class with fervour and aired his heresies with uncommon gusto if he took with equal geniality colonel warren s staid remonstrance and mac s fiery objurgation sunday morning invariably found him more \"agnostic\" than ever stoutly declining to recognise the necessity for \"service \" for this was an occasion when you couldn t argue or floor anybody or hope to make mac \"hoppin mad or have the smallest kind of a shindy the colonel read the lessons mac prayed and they all sang particularly o flynn now the boy couldn t sing a note so there was no fair division of entertainment wherefore he would go off into the woods with his gun for company and the catholic o flynn and even potts were in better odour than he down in camp\" on sundays so far you may travel and yet not escape the tyranny of the \"outworn creeds \" the boy came back a full hour before service on the second sunday with a couple of grouse and a beaming countenance mac who was cook that week was the only man left in the tent he looked agreeably surprised at the apparition hello says he more pleasantly than his sunday gloom usually permitted \"back in time for service \" i ve found a native says the boy speaking as proudly as any columbus \"he s hurt his foot and he s only got one eye but he s splendid told me no end of things he s coming here as fast as his foot will let him he and three other indians esquimaux i mean they haven t had anything to eat but berries and roots for seven days \" the boy was feverishly overhauling the provisions behind the stove look here says mac \"hold on there i don t know that we ve come all this way to feed a lot o dirty savages \" but they re starving then seeing that that fact did not produce the desired impression \"my savage is an awfully good fellow he he s a converted savage seems to be quite a christian \" then hastily following up his advantage \"he s been taught english by the jesuits at the mission forty miles above us on the river he can give us a whole heap o tips \" mac was slowly bringing out a small panful of cold boiled beans there are four of them said the boy \"big fellows almost as big as our colonel and awful hungry \" mac looked at the handful of beans and then at the small sheet iron stove there are more cooking says he not over cordially the one that talks good english is the son of the chief you can see he s different from the others knows a frightful lot he s taught me some of his language already the men with him said kaiomi to everything i asked and that means no savvy says he ll teach me he ll teach all of us how to snow shoe we know how to snow shoe oh i mean on those long narrow snow shoes that make you go so fast you always trip up he ll show us how to steer with a pole and how to make fish traps and and everything mac began measuring out some tea he s got a team of esquimaux dogs calls em mahlemeuts and he s got a birch bark canoe and a skin kyak from the coast then with an inspiration \"his people are the sort of royal family down there added the boy thinking to appeal to the britisher s monarchical instincts mac had meditatively laid his hand on a side of bacon the boy s eyes following he s asked us all of us and we re five up to visit him at pymeut the first village above us here \" mac took up a knife to cut the bacon and good gracious why i forgot the grouse they can have the grouse no they can t said mac firmly \"they re lucky to get bacon \" the boy s face darkened ominously when he looked like that the elder men found it was \"healthiest to give him his head \" but the young face cleared as quickly as it had clouded after all the point wasn t worth fighting for since grouse would take time to cook and here were the natives coming painfully along the shore the boy ran out and shouted and waved his cap the other men of the camp who had gone in the opposite direction across the river ice to look at an air hole came hurrying back and reached camp about the same time as the visitors thought you said they were big fellows commented mac who had come to the door for a glimpse of the indians as they toiled up the slope well so they are why the colonel would make two of any one of them the colonel oh well you can t expect anybody else to be quite as big as that i was in a hurry but i suppose what i meant was they could eat as much as the colonel how do you know well just look how broad they are it doesn t matter to your stomach whether you re big up and down or big to and fro it s their furs make em look like that they re the most awful little runts i ever saw well i reckon you d think they were big too big as nova scotia if you d found em come on em suddenly like that in the woods which is the oh the son of the chief is in the middle the one who is taking off his civilised fur coat he says his father s got a heap of pelts you could get things for your collection mac and he s got two reindeer skin shirts with hoods parkis you know like the others are wearing they were quite near now how do said the foremost native affably how do the boy came forward and shook hands as though he hadn t seen him for a month \"this says he turning first to mac and then to the other white men this is prince nicholas of pymeut walk right in all of you and have something to eat \" the visitors sat on the ground round the stove as close as they could get without scorching and the atmosphere was quickly heavy with their presence when they slipped back their hoods it was seen that two of the men wore the \"tartar tonsure after the fashion of the coast where do you come from \" inquired the colonel of the man nearest him who simply blinked and was dumb this is the one that talks english said the boy indicating nicholas and he lives at pymeut and he s been converted how far is pymeut we sleep pymeut to night says nicholas which way the native jerked his head up the river many people there he nodded white men too he shook his head how far to the nearest white men nicholas s mind wandered from the white man s catechism and fixed itself on his race s immemorial problem how far it was to the nearest thing to eat i thought you said he could speak english so he can first rate he and i had a great pow wow didn t we nicholas nicholas smiled absently and fixed his one eye on the bacon that mac was cutting on the deal box into such delicate slices he ll talk all right said the boy \"when he s had some breakfast \" mac had finished the cutting and now put the frying pan on an open hole in the little stove cook him inquired nicholas yes don t you cook him take heap time cook him you couldn t eat it raw nicholas nodded emphatically mac said \"no but the boy was curious to see if they would really eat it uncooked let them have some of it raw while the rest is frying\" and he beckoned the visitors to the deal box they made a dart forward gathered up the fat bacon several slices at a time and pushed it into their mouths ugh said the colonel under his breath mac quickly swept what was left into the frying pan and began to cut a fresh lot the boy divided the cold beans got out biscuits and poured the tea while silence and a strong smell of ancient fish and rancid seal pervaded the little tent o flynn put a question or two but nicholas had gone stone deaf there was no doubt about it they had been starving after a good feed they sat stolidly by the fire with no sign of consciousness save the blinking of beady eyes till the colonel suggested a smoke then they all grinned broadly and nodded with great vigour even those who had no other english understood \"tobacco \" when he had puffed awhile nicholas took his pipe out of his mouth and looking at the boy said you no savvy catch fish in winter through the ice no how you do it make hole put down trap heap fish all winter you get enough to live on asked the colonel they must have dried fish too left over from the summer said mac nicholas agreed \"and berries and flour when snow begin get soft pymeuts all go off \" he motioned with his big head towards the hills what do you get there mac was becoming interested caribou moose any furs yes trap ermun marten lynx too i suppose and fox nicholas nodded \"all kinds wolf muskrat otter wolverine all kinds \" you got some skins now asked the nova scotian y yes more when snow get soft you come pymeut me show where have ye been just now asked o flynn st michael how long since ye left there twelve sleeps he means thirteen days nicholas nodded they couldn t possibly walk that far in oh yes says the boy \"they don t follow the windings of the river they cut across the portage you know \" snow come no trail big mountains all get lost what did you go to st michael s for oh me pilot me go all over me leave n a t and t boat st michael s last trip then you re in the employ of the great north american trading and transportation company nicholas gave that funny little duck of the head that meant yes that s how you learnt english says the colonel no me learn english at holy cross me been baptize at that jesuit mission up yonder forty mile well says potts \"i guess you ve had enough walking for one winter \" nicholas seemed not to follow this observation the boy interpreted you heap tired eh you no go any more long walk till ice go out eh nicholas grinned me go ikogimeut all pymeut go what for big feast oh the russian mission there gives a feast no big innuit feast when pretty quick every year big feast down to ikogimeut when yukon ice get hard so man go safe with dog team do many people go all innuit go plenty ingalik go how far do they come all over come from koserefsky come from anvik sometime nulato why nulato s an awful distance from ikogimeut three hundred and twenty miles said the pilot proud of his general information and quite ready since he had got a pipe between his teeth to be friendly and communicative what do you do at ikogimeut when you have these \"big fire big feed tell heap stories big dance oh heap big time \" once every year eh down at ikogimeut three times ev year ev village and he lowered his voice not with any hit of reverence or awe but with an air of making a sly and cheerful confidence \"and when man die \" you make a feast and have a dance when a friend dies if no priests priests no like priests say man no dead man gone up nicholas pondered the strange saying and slowly shook his head in that the priests are right said mac grudgingly it was anything but politic but for the life of him the boy couldn t help chipping in you think when man dead he stay dead eh and you might as well make a feast nicholas gave his quick nod \"we got heap muskeetah we cold we hungry we here heap long time dead man he done why no big feast oh yes heap big feast \" the boy was enraptured he would gladly have encouraged these pagan deliverances on the part of the converted prince but the colonel was scandalised and mac although in his heart of hearts not ill satisfied at the evidence of the skin deep christianity of a man delivered over to the corrupt teaching of the jesuits found in this last fact all the stronger reason for the instant organisation of a good protestant prayer meeting nicholas of pymeut must not be allowed to think it was only jesuits who remembered the sabbath day to keep it holy and the three \"pore benighted heathen\" along with him if they didn t understand english words they should have an object lesson and mac would himself pray the prayers they couldn t utter for themselves he jumped up motioned the boy to put on more wood cleared away the granite ware dishes filled the bean pot and set it back to simmer while the colonel got out mac s bible and his own prayer book the boy did his stoking gloomily reading aright these portents almost eclipsed was joy in this \"find\" of his for he regarded the precious nicholas as his own special property it was all going to end in his the boy s being hooked in for service as long as the esquimaux were there he couldn t of course tear himself away and here was the chance they d all been waiting for here was a native chock full of knowledge of the natural law and the immemorial gospel of the north who would be gone soon oh very soon if mac and the colonel went on like this and they were going to choke off nicholas s communicativeness with a service it s sunday you know says the colonel to the prince laying open his book \"and we were just going to have church you are accustomed to going to church at holy cross aren t you \" when me kid me go church you haven t gone since you grew up they still have church there don t they oh father brachet him have church why don t you go nicholas was vaguely conscious of threatened disapproval me me must take up fish traps can t you do that another day it seemed not to have occurred to nicholas before he sat and considered the matter isn t father brachet began the colonel gravely \"he doesn t like it does he when you don t come to church \" he take care him church him know me take care me fish trap but nicholas saw plainly out of his one eye that he was not growing in popularity suddenly that solitary organ gleamed with self justification me bring fish to father brachet and to mother aloysius and the sisters mac and the colonel exchanged dark glances do mother aloysius and the sisters live where father brachet does father brachet and father wills and brother paul and brother etienne all here the native put two fingers on the floor \"big white cross in middle\" he laid down his pipe to personate the cross \"here\" indicating the other side \"here mother aloysius and the sisters \" i thought says mac \"we d be hearing of a convent convenient \" me help father brachet observed nicholas proudly \"me show him boys how make traps show him girls how make mucklucks \" \" what \" gasps the horrified mac \"father brachet has got a family \" famly inquired nicholas \"kaiomi\" and he shook his head uncertainly you say father brachet has got boys and as though this were a yet deeper brand of iniquity \" girls \" nicholas though greatly mystified nodded firmly i suppose he thinks away off up here nobody will ever know oh these jesuits how many children has this shameless priest father brachet him got seventeen boys and me no savvy how much girl twelve girl twenty girl the boy who had been splitting with inward laughter exploded at this juncture he keeps a native school mac yes says nicholas \"teach boy make table chair potatoes grow all kinds sisters teach girl make dinner wash all kinds heap good people up at holy cross \" divil a doubt of it says o flynn but this blind belauding of the children of loyola only fired mac the more to give the heathen a glimpse of the true light in what darkness must they grope when a sly intriguing jesuit it was well known they were all like that was for them a type of the \"heap good man\" a priest forsooth who winked at sabbath breaking because he and his neighbouring nuns shared in the spoil well they must try to have a truly impressive service mac and the colonel telegraphed agreement on this head savages were said to be specially touched by music i suppose when you were a kid the jesuits taught you chants and so on said the colonel kindly kaiomi answered nicholas after reflection you can sing can t you asks o flynn sing no me dance the boy roared with delight why yes i never thought of that you fellows do the songs and nicholas and i ll do the dances mac glowered angrily \"look here if you don t mind being blasphemous for yourself don t demoralise the natives \" well i like that didn t miriam dance before the lord why shouldn t nicholas and me the colonel cleared his throat and began to read the lessons for the day the natives sat and watched him closely they really behaved very well and the boy was enormously proud of his new friends there was a great deal at stake the boy felt he must walk warily and he already regretted those light expressions about dancing before the lord all the fun of the winter might depend on a friendly relation between pymeut and the camp it was essential that the esquimaux should not only receive but make a good impression the singing \"from greenland s icy mountains to india s coral strand\" seemed to please them but when after the colonel s \"here endeth the second lesson mac said in sepulchral tones let us pray the visitors seemed to think it was time to go home no said mac sternly they mustn t go in the middle of the meeting\" and he proceeded to kneel down but nicholas was putting on his fur coat and the others only waited to follow him out the boy greatly concerned lest after all the visit should end badly dropped on his knees to add the force of his own example and through the opening phrases of mac s prayer the agnostic was heard saying in a loud stage whisper \"do like me down look here suppose you ask us come big feast and in the middle of your dance we all go home oh no remonstrated nicholas very well these friends o mine no like man go home in the middle they heap mad at me when i no stay you savvy me savvy says nicholas slowly and rather depressed kneel down then says the boy and first nicholas and then the others went on their knees alternately they looked in the boy s corner where the grub was and then over their shoulders at the droning mac and back catching the boy s eye and returning his reassuring nods and grins mac who had had no innings up to this point was now embarked upon a most congenial occupation wrestling with the lord on behalf of the heathen he lost count of time on and on the prayer wound its slow way involution after involution coil after coil like a snake the boy thought lazing in the sun unaccustomed knees grew sore hearken to the cry of them that walk in darkness misled by wolves in sheep s clothing wolves lord wearing the sign of the holy cross o flynn shuffled and mac pulled himself up no light task this of conveying to the creator in covert terms a due sense of the iniquity of the jesuits without at the same time stirring o flynn s bile and seeing him get up and stalk out of meeting as had happened once before o flynn was not deeply concerned about religious questions but \"there were limits \" the problem was how to rouse the lord without rousing o flynn a piece of negotiation so delicate calling for a skill in pious invective so infinitely absorbing to mac s particular cast of mind that he was quickly stone blind and deaf to all things else not all the heathen are sunk in iniquity but they are weak tempted and they weary lord amen said the boy discreetly \"how long \" groaned mac \"oh lord how long \" but it was much longer than he realised the boy saw the visitors shifting from one knee to another and feared the worst but he sympathised deeply with their predicament to ease his own legs he changed his position and dragged a corner of the sailcloth down off the little pile of provisions and doubled it under his knees the movement revealed the bag of dried apples within arm s length nicholas was surreptitiously reaching for his coat no doubt about it he had come to the conclusion that this was the fitting moment to depart a look over his shoulder showed mac absorbed and taking fresh breath at \"sixthly oh lord \" the boy put out a hand and dragged the apple bag slowly softly towards him the prince dropped the sleeve of his coat and fixed his one eye on his friend the boy undid the neck of the sack thrust in his hand and brought out a fistfull another look at mac still hard at it trying to spare o flynn s feelings without mincing matters with the almighty the boy winked at nicholas made a gesture \"catch \" and fired a bit of dried apple at him at the same time putting a piece in his own mouth to show him it was all right nicholas followed suit and seemed pleased with the result he showed all his strong white teeth and ecstatically winked his one eye back at the boy who threw him another bit and then a piece to each of the others the colonel had \"caught on and was making horrible frowns at the boy potts and o flynn looked up and in dumbshow demanded a share no very well they d tell mac so the boy had to feed them too to keep them quiet and still mac prayed the lord to catch up this slip he had made here on the yukon with reference to the natives in the midst of a powerful peroration he happened to open his eyes a little and they fell on the magnificent great sable collar of prince nicholas s coat without any of the usual slowing down without the accustomed warning of a gradual descent from the high themes of heaven to the things of common earth mac came down out of the clouds with a bump and the sudden business like amen\" startled all the apple chewing congregation mac stood up and says he to nicholas where did you get that coat nicholas still on his knees stared and seemed in doubt if this were a part of the service where did you get that coat repeated mac the boy had jumped up nimbly \"i told you his father has a lot of furs \" like this no says nicholas \"this belong white man \" ha says mac excitedly \"i thought i d seen it before tell us how you got it \" me leave st michael me got ducks reindeer meat oh plenty kow kow footnote food two sleeps away st michael me meet indian heap hungry him got bully coat nicholas picked it up off the floor him got no kow kow him say give me duck give me back fat you take coat him too heavy me say yes but how did he get the coat him say two white men came down river on big ice yes yes men sick he tapped his forehead \"man no sick he no go down with the ice\" and nicholas shuddered \"before ikogimeut ice jam indian see men jump one big ice here more big ice here and one go down indian\" nicholas imitated throwing out a line \"man tie mahout round but big ice come \" nicholas dashed his hands together and then paused significantly \"indian sleep there next day ice hard indian go little way out to see man dead him heap good coat he wound up unemotionally and proceeded to put it on and the other white man what became of him \" nicholas shrugged \"kaiomi though it was plain he knew well enough the other lay under the yukon ice and that that was the end of the fellows who went by jeering at us \" we d better not crow yet said mac and they bade prince nicholas and his heathen retinue good bye in a mood chastened not by prayer alone chapter ii house warming there is a sort of moral climate in a household john morley no idle ceremony this but the great problem of the dwellers in the country of the yukon the colonel and the boy made up their minds that whatever else they had or had not they would have a warm house to live in and when they had got it they would have a \"blow out\" to celebrate the achievement we ll invite nicholas says the boy \"i ll go to pymeut myself and let him know we are going to have big fire big feed oh heap big time \" if the truth were told it had been a difficult enough matter to keep away from pymeut since the hour nicholas had vanished in that direction but until winter quarters were made and until they were proved to be warm there was no time for the amenities of life the big cabin as it was quite seriously called in contradistinction to the hut of the trio consisted of a single room measuring on the outside sixteen feet by eighteen feet the walls of cotton wood logs soared upward to a level of six feet and this height was magnificently increased in the middle by the angle of the mildly gable roof but before the cabin was breast high the boy had begun to long for a window sorry we forgot the plate glass says mac wudn t ye like a grrand piana asks o flynn what s the use of goin all the way from nova scotia to caribou says the boy to the schoolmaster miner \"if you haven t learned the way to make a window like the indians out of transparent skin \" mac assumed an air of elevated contempt i went to mine not to learn indian tricks when the door s shut it ll be dark as the inside of a cocoa nut you ought to have thought of that before you left the sunny south said potts it ll be dark all winter window or no window mac reminded them never mind said the colonel \"when the candles give out we ll have the fire light keep all the spruce knots boys \" but one of the boys was not pleased the next day looking for a monkey wrench under the tarpaulin he came across the wooden box a california friend had given him at parting containing a dozen tall glass jars of preserved fruit the others had growled at the extra bulk and weight when the boy put the box into the boat at st michael s but they had now begun to look kindly on it and ask when it was to be opened he had answered firmly not before christmas modifying this since nicholas s visit to \"not before the house warming \" but one morning the boy was found pouring the fruit out of the jars into some empty cans what you up to wait an see he went to o flynn who was dish washer that week got him to melt a couple of buckets of snow over the open air campfire and wash the fruit jars clean now colonel says the boy \"bring along that buck saw o yours and lend a hand \" they took off the top log from the south wall of the cabin measured a two foot space in the middle and the colonel sawed out the superfluous spruce intervening while he went on doing the same for the other logs on that side the boy roughly chiselled a moderately flat sill then one after another he set up six of the tall glass jars in a row and showed how alternating with the other six bottles turned upside down the thick belly of one accommodating itself to the thin neck of the other the twelve made a very decent rectangle of glass when they had hoisted up and fixed in place the logs on each side and the big fellow that went all across on top when they had filled the inconsiderable cracks between the bottles with some of the mud mortar with which the logs were to be chinked behold a double glass window fit for a king the boy was immensely pleased oh that s an old dodge said mac depreciatingly \"why they did that at caribou \" then why in why didn t you suggest it you wait till you know more about this kind o life and you won t go in for fancy touches nevertheless the man who had mined at caribou seemed to feel that some contribution from him was necessary to offset the huge success of that window he did not feel called upon to help to split logs for the roof of the big cabin but he sat cutting and whittling away at a little shelf which he said was to be nailed up at the right of the big cabin door its use was not apparent but no one dared call it a \"fancy touch for mac was a miner and had been to caribou when the shelf was nailed up its maker brought forth out of his medicine chest a bottle of perry davis s pain killer now at caribou says he they haven t got any more thermometers kicking round than we have here but they discovered that when perry davis congeals you must keep a sharp look out for frost bite and when perry davis freezes solid you d better mind your eye and stay in your cabin if you don t want to die on the trail \" with which he tied a string round perry davis s neck set the bottle up on the shelf and secured it firmly in place they all agreed it was a grand advantage to have been to caribou but mac knew things that he had probably not learned there about trees and rocks and beasts and their manners and customs and family names if there were more than a half truth in the significant lament of a very different man \"i should be a poet if only i knew the names of things then indeed samuel maccann was equipped to make a mark in literature from the time he set foot on the volcanic shore of st michael s island mac had begun his collection \" nowadays when he would spend over \"that truck of his\" hours that might profitably considering his talents be employed in helping to fortify the camp against the arctic winter his companions felt it little use to remonstrate by themselves they got on rapidly with work on the roof very much helped by three days unexpectedly mild weather when the split logs had been marshalled together on each side of the comb they covered them with dried moss and spruce boughs over all they laid a thick blanket of the earth which had been dug out to make a level foundation the cracks in the walls were chinked with moss and mud mortar the floor was the naked ground \"to be carpeted with skins by and by so mac said but nobody believed mac would put a skin to any such sensible use the unreasonable mildness of three or four days and the little surface thaw came to an abrupt end in a cold rain that turned to sleet as it fell nobody felt like going far afield just then even after game but they had set the snare that nicholas told the boy about on that first encounter in the wood nicholas it seemed had given him a noose made of twisted sinew and showed how it worked in a running loop he had illustrated the virtue of this noose when attached to a pole balanced in the crotch of a tree caught over a horizontal stick by means of a small wooden pin tied to the snare a touch at the light end of the suspended pole where the baited loop dangles loosens the pin and the heavy end of the pole falls hanging ptarmigan or partridge in the air for some time after rigging this contrivance whenever anyone reported tracks mac and the boy would hasten to the scene of action and set a new snare piling brush on each side of the track that the game had run in so barring other ways and presenting a line of least resistance straight through the loop in the early days mac would come away from these preparations saying with dry pleasure now with luck we may get a xema sabinii or some such fearful wildfowl good to eat \" the boy would ask having had his disappointments ere now in moments of hunger for fresh meat when mac with the nearest approach to enthusiasm he permitted himself had brought in some miserable little hawk owl or a three toed woodpecker to add not to the larder but to the \"collection \" no you don t eat sabine gulls mac would answer pityingly but those snares never seemed to know what they were there for the first one was set expressly to catch one of the commonest birds that fly mac s lagopus albus the beautiful white arctic grouse or at the very least a bonasa umbellus which being interpreted is ruffed ptarmigan the tracks had been bird tracks but the creature that swung in the air next day was a baby hare the schoolmaster looked upon the incident as being in the nature of a practical joke and resented it but the others were enchanted and professed thereafter a rooted suspicion of the soundness of the schoolmaster s natural history which nobody actually felt for he had never yet pretended to know anything that he didn t know well and when potts would say something disparaging of mac s learning behind his back which was against the unwritten rules of the game the colonel invariably sat on potts knows a darned sight too much no he don t sir that s just the remarkable thing about mac he isn t trying to carry any more than he can swing at the same time it is to be feared that none of his companions really appreciated the pedagogue s learning nor had anyone but the boy sympathised with his resolution to make a collection what they wanted was eatable game and they affected no intelligent interest in knowing the manners and customs of the particular species that was sending up appetising odours from the pot they even applauded the rudeness of the boy who one day responded to mac s gravely jubilant \"look here i ve got the parus hudsonicus \" poor old man what do you do for it and when anybody after that was indisposed they said he might be sickening for an attack of parus hudsonicus and in that case it was a bad look out well for mac that he wouldn t have cared a red cent to impress the greatest naturalist alive let alone a lot of fellows who didn t know a titmouse from a disease meanwhile work on the big cabin had gone steadily forward from the outside it looked finished now and distinctly imposing from what were left of the precious planks out of the bottom of the best boat they had made the door two by four and opening directly in front of that masterpiece the rock fireplace the great stone chimney was the pride of the camp and the talk before the winter was done of all \"the lower river \" spurred on partly by the increased intensity of the cold partly by the colonel s nonsense about the way they did it \"down south mac roused himself and turned out a better piece of masonry for the big cabin than he had thought necessary for his own but everybody had a share in the glory of that fireplace the colonel potts and the boy selected the stone and brought it on a rude litter out of a natural quarry from a place a mile or more away up on the bare mountain side o flynn mixed and handed up the mud mortar while mac put in some brisk work with it before it stiffened in the increasing cold everybody was looking forward to getting out of the tent and into the warm cabin and the building of the fireplace stirred enthusiasm it was two and a half feet deep three and a half feet high and four feet wide and when furnished with ten inch hack logs packed in glowing ashes and laid one above another with a roaring good blaze in front of birch and spruce that fire would take a lot of beating as the boy admitted even in the tat pine florida country \" but no fire on earth could prevent the cabin from being swept through the moment the door was opened by a fierce and icy air current the late autumnal gales revealed the fact that the sole means of ventilation had been so nicely contrived that whoever came in or went out admitted a hurricane of draught that nearly knocked him down potts said it took a good half hour after anyone had opened the door to heat the place up again what you cold inquired the usual culprit the boy had come in to put an edge on his chopper \"it s stopped snowin an you better come along with me potts swing an axe for a couple of hours that ll warm you \" i ve got rheumatism in my shoulder to day says potts hugging the huge fire closer and you ve got something wrong with your eyes eh mac potts narrowed his and widened the great mouth but he had turned his head so mac couldn t see him the nova scotian only growled and refilled his pipe up in the woods the boy repeated the conversation to the colonel who looked across at o flynn several yards away and said \"hush \" why must i shut up mac s eyes do look rather queer and bloodshot i should think he d rather feel we lay it to his eyes than know we re afraid he s peterin out altogether i never said i was afraid no you haven t said much \"i haven t opened my head about it \" no but you ve tried hard enough for five or six days to get mac to the point where he would come out and show us how to whip saw you haven t said anything but you ve you ve got pretty dignified each time you failed and we all know what that means we ought to have begun sawing boards for our bunks and swing shelf a week back before this heavy snowfall besides there s enough fire wood now we re only marking time until until mac s eyes get all right i understand again the colonel had made a sound like \"sh \" and went on swinging his axe they worked without words till the boy s tree came down then he stopped a moment and wiped his face it isn t so cold to day not by a long shot for all potts s howling about his rheumatics it isn t cold that starts that kind of pain no siree i m not much of a doctor but i can see potts s rheumatism doesn t depend on the weather never you mind potts i don t mind potts i only mind mac what s the matter with mac anyway oh he s just got cold feet maybe he ll thaw out by and by did you ever think what mac s like with that square cut jaw and sawed off nose everything about him goin like this the boy described a few quick blunt angles in the air \"well sir he s the livin image of a monkey wrench i m comin to think he s as much like it inside as he is out he can screw up for a prayer meetin or he can screw down for business when he s a mind but as jimmie over there says the divil a different pace can you put him through i like monkey wrenches i m only sayin they aren t as limber as willa trees \" no response from the colonel who was making the chips fly it had cost his great body a good many aches and bruises but he was a capital axeman now and not such a bad carpenter though when the boy said as much he had answered carpenter i m just a sort of a well meanin wood butcher and deeply he regretted that in all his young years on a big place in the country he had learnt so little about anything but horses and cattle on the way back to dinner they spoke again of this difficulty of the boards o flynn whistled \"rory o more\" with his pleasant air of detachment you and the others would take more interest in the subject said the boy a little hotly \"if we hadn t let you fellows use nearly all the boat planks for your bunks and now we haven t got any for our own \" let us use em faith we had a right to m to boards out of our boat and ye can have the loan o the whip saw to make more whenever the fancy takes ye loan o the whip saw why it s mine says the colonel divil a bit of it man says o flynn serenely \"everything we ve got belongs to all of us except a sack o coffee a medicine chest and a dimmi john and it s mesilf that s afraid the dimmi john \" what s the use of my having bought a whip saw interrupted the colonel hurriedly \"what s the good of it if the only man that knows how to use it \" is more taken up wid bein a guardjin angel to his pardner s dimmi john the colonel turned and frowned at the proprietor of the dimmi john the boy had dropped behind to look at some marten tracks in the fresh fallen snow i ll follow that trail after dinner says he catching up the others in time to hear o flynn say if it wusn t that ye think only a feller that s been to caribou can teach ye annything it s jimmie o flynn that ud show ye how to play a chune on that same whip saw will you show us after dinner sure i will and he was as good as his word this business of turning a tree into boards without the aid of a saw mill is a thing many placer miners have to learn for even if they are disposed to sleep on the floor and to do without shelves they can t do sluicing without sluice boxes and they can t make those long narrow boxes without boards so every party that is well fitted out has a whip saw furrst ye dig a pit o flynn had said airily stretched out before the fire after dinner \"make it about four feet deep and as long as ye d like yer boards when ye ve done that i ll come and take a hand \" the little job was not half finished when the light tailed two days more of soil burning and shovelling saw it done now ye sling a couple o saplings acrost the durrt ye ve chucked out r right now ye roll yer saw timber inter the middle r right an on each side ye want a log to stand on see wid yer guide man on top sthradlin yer timberr watchin the chalk line and doin the pull up and the otherr fellerr in the pit lookin afther the haul down ye ll be able to play a chune wid that there whip saw that ll make the serryphims sick o plain harps o flynn superintended it all and even potts had the curiosity to come out and see what they were up to mac was \"kind o dozin \" by the fire when the frame was finished o flynn helped to put the trial log in place having marked it off with charcoal to indicate inch and a quarter planks then the colonel down in the pit and o flynn on top of the frame took the great two handled saw between them and began laboriously one drawing the big blade up and the other down vertically through the log along the charcoal line an that s how it s done wid bits of yer arrums and yer back that have niver been called on to wurruk befure an whin ye ve been at it an hour ye ll find it goes betther wid a little blasphemin and he gave his end of the saw to the reluctant potts potts was about this time as much of a problem to his pardners as was the ex schoolmaster if the bank clerk had surprised them all by his handiness on board ship and by making a crane to swing the pots over the fire he surprised them all still more in these days by an apparent eclipse of his talents it was unaccountable potts s carpentering potts s all round cleverness was like \"payrock in a pocket as the miners say speedily worked out and not a trace of it afterwards to be found but less and less was the defection of the trio felt the burly kentucky stock farmer was getting his hand in at frontier\" work though he still couldn t get on without his \"nigger as the boy said slyly indicating that it was he who occupied this exalted post these two soon had the bunks made out of the rough planks they had sawed with all a green horn s pains they put in a fragrant mattress of spring moss and on that made up a bed of blankets and furs more boards were laboriously turned out to make the great swing shelf to hang up high in the angle of the roof where the provisions might be stored out of reach of possible marauders the days were very short now bringing only about five hours of pallid light so little of which struggled through the famous bottle window that at all hours they depended chiefly on the blaze from the great fireplace there was still a good deal of work to be done indoors shelves to be put up on the left as you entered whereon the granite ware tea service etc was kept a dinner table to be made and three legged stools while these additions fancy touches as the trio called them were being made potts and o flynn although occasionally they went out for an hour or two shot gun on shoulder seldom brought home anything and for the most part were content with doing what they modestly considered their share of the cooking and washing for the rest they sat by the fire playing endless games of euchre seven up and bean poker while mac more silent than ever smoked and read copps s mining laws\" and the magazines of the previous august nobody heard much in those days of caribou the colonel had gradually slipped into the position of boss of the camp the trio were still just a trifle afraid of him and he on his side never pressed a dangerous issue too far but this is a little to anticipate one bitter gray morning that had reduced perry davis to a solid lump of ice o flynn the colonel and the boy were bringing into the cabin the last of the whip sawed boards the colonel halted and looked steadily up the river is that a beast or a human said he it s a man the boy decided after a moment \"no two men single file and yes colonel it s dogs hooray a dog team at last \" they had simultaneously dropped the lumber the boy ran on to tell the cook to prepare more grub and then pelted after o flynn and the colonel who had gone down to meet the newcomers an indian driving five dogs which were hitched tandem to a low esquimaux sled with a pack and two pairs of web foot snow shoes lashed on it and followed by a white man the indian was a fine fellow younger than prince nicholas and better off in the matter of eyes the white man was a good deal older than either with grizzled hair a worn face bright dark eyes and a pleasant smile i had heard some white men had camped hereabouts says he \"i am glad to see we have such substantial neighbours \" he was looking up at the stone chimney conspicuous a long way off we didn t know we had any white neighbours said the colonel in his most grand and gracious manner \"how far away are you sir \" about forty miles above as he answered he happened to be glancing at the boy and observed his eagerness cloud slightly hadn t nicholas said it was \"about forty miles above\" that the missionaries lived but to be only forty miles away the stranger went on misinterpreting the fading gladness \"is to be near neighbours in this country \" we aren t quite fixed yet said the colonel \"but you must come in and have some dinner with us we can promise you a good fire anyhow \" thank you you have chosen a fine site and the bright eyes with the deep crow s feet raying out from the corners scanned the country in so keen and knowing a fashion that the boy with hope reviving ventured are are you a prospector no i am father wills from holy cross oh and the boy presently caught up with the indian and walked on beside him looking back every now and then to watch the dogs or examine the harness the driver spoke english and answered questions with a tolerable intelligence \"are dogs often driven without reins \" the indian nodded the colonel after the stranger had introduced himself was just a shade more reserved but seemed determined not to be lacking in hospitality o flynn was overflowing or would have been had the jesuit encouraged him he told their story or more properly his own and how they had been wrecked and so ye re the father superior up there says the irishman pausing to take breath no our superior is father brachet that s a well built cabin the dogs halted though they had at least five hundred yards still to travel before they would reach the well built cabin mush shouted the indian the dogs cleared the ice reef and went spinning along so briskly over the low hummocks that the driver had to run to keep up with them the boy was flying after when the priest having caught sight of his face called out \"here wait stop a moment \" and hurried forward he kicked through the ice crust gathered up a handful of snow and began to rub it on the boy s right cheek what in the name of the boy was drawing back angrily keep still ordered the priest \"your cheek is frozen\" and he applied more snow and more friction \"you ought to watch one another in such weather as this when a man turns dead white like that he s touched with frost bite \" after he had restored the circulation \"there now don t go near the fire or it will begin to hurt \" thank you said the boy a little shame faced \"it s all right now i suppose \" i think so said the priest \"you ll lose the skin and you may be a little sore nothing to speak of with which he fell back to the colonel s side the dogs had settled down into a jog trot now but were still well on in front is mush their food \" asked the boy mush no fish why does your indian go on like that about mush then oh that s the only word the dogs know except a certain expressions we try to discourage the indians from using in the old days the dog drivers used to say mahsh now you never hear anything but swearing and mush a corruption of the french canadian marche he turned to the colonel \"you ll get over trying to wear cheechalko boots here nothing like mucklucks with a wisp of straw inside for this country \" i agree wid ye i got me a pair in st michael s says o flynn proudly turning out his enormous feet \"never wore anything so comf table in me life \" you ought to have drill parkis too like this of mine to keep out the wind they were going up the slope now obliquely to the cabin close behind the dogs who were pulling spasmodically between their little rests father wills stooped and gathered up some moss that the wind had swept almost bare of snow \"you see that \" he said to o flynn while the boy stopped and the colonel hurried on \"wherever you find that growing no man need starve \" the colonel looked back before entering the cabin and saw that the boy seemed to have forgotten not alone the indian but the dogs and was walking behind with the jesuit face upturned smiling as friendly as you please within a different picture potts and mac were having a row about something and the colonel struck in sharply on their growling comments upon each other s character and probable destination got plenty to eat two hungry men coming in one s an indian and you know what that means and the other s a catholic priest it was this bomb that he had hurried on to get exploded and done with before the said priest should appear on the scene a what mac raised his heavy eyes with fight in every wooden feature a jesuit priest is what i said he won t eat his dinner here that is exactly what he will do not by whether it was the monstrous proposition that had unstrung mac he was obliged to steady himself against the table with a shaking hand but he set those square features of his like iron and says he no jesuit sits down to the same table with me that means then that you ll eat alone not if i know it the colonel slid in place the heavy wooden bar that had never before been requisitioned to secure the door and he came and stood in the middle of the cabin where he could let out all his inches just clearing the swing shelf he pulled his great figure up to its full height and standing there like a second goliath he said quite softly in that lingo of his childhood that always came back to his tongue s tip in times of excitement \"just as shuah as yo bohn that priest will eat his dinner to day in my cabin sah and if yo going t make any trouble just say so now and we ll get it ovah and the place cleaned up again befoh our visitors arrive \" mind what you re about mac growled potts \"you know he could lick the stuffin out o you \" the ex schoolmaster produced some sort of indignant sound in his throat and turned as if he meant to go out the colonel came a little nearer mac flung up his head and squared for battle potts in a cold sweat dropped a lot of tinware with a rattle while the colonel said \"no no we ll settle this after the people go mac \" then in a whisper \"look here i ve been trying to shield you for ten days don t give yourself away now before the first white neighbour that comes to see us you call yourself a christian just see if you can t behave like one for an hour or two to a fellow creature that s cold and hungry come you re the man we ve always counted on do the honours and take it out of me after our guests are gone \" mac seemed in a haze he sat down heavily on some beanbags in the corner and when the newcomers were brought in and introduced he \"did the honours\" by glowering at them with red eyes never breaking his surly silence well says father wills looking about \"i must say you re very comfortable here if more people made homes like this there d be fewer failures \" they gave him the best place by the fire and potts dished up dinner there were only two stools made yet the boy rolled his section of sawed spruce over near the priest and prepared to dine at his side no no said father wills firmly \"you shall sit as far away from this splendid blaze as you can get or you will have trouble with that cheek \" so the boy had to yield his place to o flynn and join mac over on the bean bags why didn t you get a parki when you were at st michael s said the priest as this change was being effected we had just as much more than we could carry besides i thought we could buy furs up river anyway i m warm enough no you are not returned the priest smiling \"you must get a parki with a hood \" i ve got an arctic cap it rolls down over my ears and goes all round my neck just leaves a little place in front for my eyes yes wear that if you go on the trail but the good of the parki hood is that it is trimmed all round with long wolf hair you see he picked his parki up off the floor and showed it to the company \"those long hairs standing out all round the face break the force of the wind it is wonderful how the esquimaux hood lessens the chance of frost bite \" while the only object in the room that he didn t seem to see was mac he was most taken up with the fireplace the colonel laid great stress on the enormous services of the delightful accomplished master mason over there on the beanbags who sat looking more than ever like a monkey wrench incarnate but whether that jesuit was as wily as the calvinist thought he had quite wit enough to overlook the great chimney builder s wrathful silence he was not the least \"professional talked about the country and how to live here saying incidentally that he had spent twelve years at the mission of the holy cross the yukon wasn t a bad place to live in he told them if men only took the trouble to learn how to live here while teaching the indians there was a great deal to learn from them as well you must all come and see our schools he wound up we d like to awfully said the boy and all but mac echoed him we were so afraid he went on that we mightn t see anybody all winter long \" oh you ll have more visitors than you want shall we though then with a modified rapture \"indians i suppose and and missionaries \" traders too and miners and this year cheechalkos as well you are directly on the great highway of winter travel now that there s a good hard crust on the snow you will have dog trains passing every week and sometimes two or three it was good news we ve already had one visitor before you said the boy looking wonderfully pleased at the prospect the priest had opened out \"you must know nicholas of pymeut don t you \" oh yes we all know nicholas and the priest smiled we like him returned the boy as if some slighting criticism had been passed upon his friend of course you do so do we all and still that look of quiet amusement on the worn face and a keener twinkle glinting in the eyes we re afraid he s sick the boy began before the priest could answer \"he was educated at howly cross he says contributed o flynn oh he s been to holy cross among other places \" what do you mean well nicholas is a most impartial person he was born at pymeut but his father who is the richest and most intelligent man in his tribe took nicholas to ikogimeut when the boy was only six he was brought up in the russian mission there as the father had been before him and was a greek in religion till he was fourteen there was a famine that year down yonder so nicholas turned catholic and came up to us he was at holy cross some years when business called him to anvik where he turned episcopalian at eagle city i believe he is regarded as a pattern presbyterian there are those that say since he has been a pilot nicholas makes six changes a trip in his religious convictions father wills saw that the colonel to whom he most frequently addressed himself took his pleasantry gravely \"nicholas is not a bad fellow he added he told me you had been kind to him \" if you believe that about his insincerity said the colonel \"are you not afraid the others you spend your life teaching may turn out as little credit to you to christianity \" the priest glanced at the listening indian \"no said he gravely i do not think all the natives are like nicholas andrew here is a true son of the church but even if it were otherwise we you know\" the jesuit rose from the table with that calm smile of his \"we simply do the work without question the issue is not in our hands \" he made the sign of the cross and set back his stool come andrew he said \"we must push on \" the indian repeated the priest s action and went out to see to the dogs oh are you going right away said the colonel politely and o flynn volubly protested we thought said the boy \"you d sit awhile and smoke and at least of course i don t mean smoke exactly but \" the father smiled and shook his head another time i would stay gladly where are you going now andrew and i are on our way to the oklahoma the steamship frozen in the ice below here how far asked the boy about seven miles below the russian mission and a mile or so up the kuskoquim slough wrecked there oh no gone into winter quarters in a slew for it was so father wills pronounced s l o u g h oh that s what they call a blind river up in this country they come into the big streams every here and there and cheechalkos are always mistaking them for the main channel sometimes they re wider and deeper for a mile or so than the river proper but before you know it they land you in a marsh this place i m going to a little way up the kuskoquim out of danger when the ice breaks up has been chosen for a new station by the n a t and t company rival you know to the old established alaska commercial that inherited the russian fur monopoly and controlled the seal and salmon trade so long well the younger company runs the old one hard and they ve sent this steamer into winter quarters loaded with provisions ready to start for dawson the instant the ice goes out why then it s the very boat that ll be takin us to the klondyke you just goin down to have a look at her asked potts enviously no i go to get relief for the pymeuts what s the matter with em epidemic all summer starvation now guess you won t find any body s got such a lot he wants to give it away to the indians our father superior has given much said the priest gently \"but we are not inexhaustible at holy cross and the long winter is before us many of the supply steamers have failed to get in and the country is flooded with gold seekers there ll be wide spread want this year terrible suffering all up and down the river \" the more reason for people to hold on to what they ve got a white man s worth more n an indian the priest s face showed no anger not even coldness white men have got a great deal out of alaska and as yet done little but harm here the government ought to help the natives and we believe the government will all we ask of the captain of the oklahoma is to sell us on fair terms a certain supply we assuming part of the risk and both of us looking to the government to make it good reckon you ll find that steamer load down in the ice is worth its weight in gold said potts one must always try replied the father he left the doorpost straightened his bowed back and laid a hand on the wooden latch but nicholas when you left pymeut was he began the boy oh he is all right the father smiled and nodded \"brother paul has been looking after nicholas s father the old chief has enough food but he has been very ill by the way have you any letters you want to send out \" oh if we d only known was the general chorus and potts flew to close and stamp one he had hardly more than begun to the future mrs potts the boy had thoughtlessly opened the door to have a look at the dogs shut that da don t keep the door open howled potts trying to hold his precious letter down on the table while he added \"only two words \" the boy slammed the door behind him with all our trouble the cabin isn t really warm said the colonel apologetically \"in a wind like this if the door is open we have to hold fast to things to keep them from running down the yukon it s a trial to anybody s temper \" why don t you build a false wall well i don t know we hadn t thought of it you d find it correct this draught and the priest explained his views on the subject while potts s letter was being addressed andrew put his head in ready father as the priest was pocketing the letter the boy dashed in put on the arctic cap he set such store by and a fur coat and mittens do you mind if i go a little way with you he said of course not answered the priest \"i will send him back in half an hour he said low to the colonel it s a hitter day \" it was curious how already he had divined the relation of the elder man to the youngest of that odd household the moment they had gone mac with an obvious effort pulled himself up out of his corner and coming towards the colonel at the fireplace he said thickly you ve put an insult upon me warren and that s what i stand from no man come outside the colonel looked at him all right mac but we ve just eaten a rousing big dinner even sullivan wouldn t accept that as the moment for a round we ll both have forty winks hey and potts shall call us and o flynn shall be umpire you can have the boy s bunk mac was in a haze again and allowed himself to be insinuated into bed the others got rid of the dinner things and \"sat round\" for an hour doubt if he sleeps long says potts a little before two \"that s what he s been doing all morning \" we haven t had any fresh meat for a week returns the colonel significantly \"why don t you and o flynn go down to meet the boy and come round by the woods there ll be full moon up by four o clock you might get a brace of grouse or a rabbit or two \" o flynn was not very keen about it but the jesuit s visit had stirred him up and he offered less opposition to the unusual call to activity than the colonel expected when at last he was left alone with the sleeping man the kentuckian put on a couple more logs and sat down to wait at three he got up swung the crane round so that the darting tongues of flame could lick the hot water pot and then he measured out some coffee in a quarter of an hour the cabin was full of the fragrance of good mocha the colonel sat and waited presently he poured out a little coffee and drank it slowly blissfully with half closed eyes but when he had set the granite cup down again he stood up alert like a man ready for business mac had been asleep nearly three hours the others wouldn t be long now well if they came prematurely they must go to the little cabin for awhile the colonel shot the bar across door and jamb for the second time that day mac stirred and lifted himself on his elbow but he wasn t really awake potts he said huskily the colonel made no sound \"potts measure me out two fingers will you cabin s damn cold \" no answer mac roused himself muttering compliments for potts when he had bundled himself out over the side of the bunk he saw the colonel seemingly dozing by the fire he waited a moment then very softly he made his way to the farther end of the swing shelf the colonel opened one eye shut it and shuffled in a sleepy sort of way mac turned sharply back to the fire the colonel opened his eyes and yawned i made some cawfee a little while back have some no better it s a where s potts gone out for a little back soon he poured out some of the strong black decoction and presented it to his companion \"just try it finest cawfee in the world sir \" mac poured it down without seeming to bother about tasting it they sat quite still after that till the colonel said meditatively you and i had a little account to settle didn t we i m ready but neither moved for several moments see here mac you haven t been ill or anything like that have you no there was no uncertain note in the answer if anything there was in it more than the usual toneless decision mac s voice was machine made as innocent of modulation as a buzz saw and with the same uncompromising finality as the shooting of a bolt \"i m ready to stand up against any man \" good interrupted the colonel \"glad o that for i m just longing to see you stand up \" mac was on his feet in a flash you had only to say so if you wanted to see me stand up against any man alive and when i sit down again it s my opinion one of us two won t be good lookin any more he pushed back the stools i thought maybe it was only necessary to mention it said the colonel slowly \"i ve been wanting for a fortnight to see you stand up\" mac turned fiercely \"against samuel david maccann \" come on i m in no mood for monkeyin nor i i realise maccann we ve come to a kind of a crisis things in this camp are either going a lot better or a lot worse after to day there s nothing wrong if you quit asking dirty jesuits to sit down with honest men yes there s something worse out o shape than that mac waited warily when we were stranded here and saw what we d let ourselves in for there wasn t one of us that didn t think things looked pretty much like the last o pea time there was just one circumstance that kept us from throwing up the sponge we had a man in camp the colonel paused mac stood as expressionless as the wooden crane a man we all believed in who was going to help us pull through that was you i s pose mac s hard voice chopped out the sarcasm you know mighty well who it was the boy s all right but he s young for this kind o thing young and heady there isn t much wrong with me that i m aware of except that i don t know shucks potts s petering out wasn t altogether a surprise and nobody expected anything from o flynn till we got to dawson when a lawyer and a fella with capital behind him may come in handy but there was one man who had a head on him who had experience and who he leaned over to emphasise the climax \"who had character it was on that man s account that i joined this party \" mac put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the wall his face began to look a little more natural the long sleep or the coffee had cleared his eyes shall i tell you what i heard about that man last night asked the colonel gravely mac looked up but never opened his lips you remember you wouldn t sit here the boy was always in and out the cabin was cold i left the boy and o flynn at supper time and went down to the little cabin to to see what i was doin to spy on me well all right maybe i was spying too incidentally i wanted to tell you the cabin was hot as blazes and get you to come to supper i met potts hurrying up for his grub and i said where s mac isn t he coming and your pardner s answer was oh let him alone he s got a flask in his bunk swillin and gruntin he s just in hog heaven damn that sneak the man he was talkin about mac was the man we had all built our hopes on i ll teach potts you can t mac potts has got to die and go to heaven perhaps to hell before he ll learn any good but you re a different breed teach maccann mac suddenly sat down on the stool with his head in his hands the boy hasn t caught on said the colonel presently \"but he said something this morning to show he was wondering about the change that s come over you \" that i don t split wood all day i suppose when we ve got enough for a month potts doesn t either why don t you go for potts as the boy said i don t care about potts it s mac that matters did the boy say that he looked up the colonel nodded after you had made that chimney you know you were a kind of hero in his eyes mac looked away \"the cabin s been cold he muttered we are going to remedy that \" i didn t bring any liquor into camp you must admit that i didn t intend i do admit it and when o flynn said that about keeping his big demijohn out of the inventory and apart from the common stores i sat on him so you did i knew it was safest to act on the medicinal purposes principle so it is but i wasn t thinking so much of o flynn i was thinking of things that had happened before for i d had experience drink was the curse of caribou it s something of a scourge up in nova scotia i d had experience you did the very best thing possible under the circumstances mac was feeling about after his self respect and must be helped to get hold of it \"i realise too that the temptation is much greater in cold countries said the kentuckian unblushingly italians and greeks don t want fiery drinks half as much as russians and scandinavians haven t the same craving as nova scotians and cold country people generally i suppose but that only shows temperance is of more vital importance in the north \" that s right it s not much in my line to shift blame even when i don t deserve it but you know so much you might as well know it wasn t i who opened that demijohn first but you don t mind being the one to shut it up do you shut it up yes let s get it down and the colonel swung it off the shelf it was nearly empty and only the boy s and the colonel s single bottles stood unbroached even so mac s prolonged spree was something of a mystery to the kentuckian it must be that a very little was too much for mac the colonel handed the demijohn to his companion and lit the solitary candle standing on its little block of wood held in place between three half driven nails what s that for don t you want to seal it up i haven t got any wax i have an inch or so the colonel produced out of his pocket the only piece in camp mac picked up a billet of wood and drove the cork in flush with the neck then placing upright on the cork the helve of the hammer he drove the cork down a quarter of an inch farther give me your wax what s for a seal they looked about mac s eye fell on a metal button that hung by a thread from the old militia jacket he was wearing he put his hand up to it paused glanced hurriedly at the colonel and let his fingers fall yes yes said the kentuckian \"that ll make a capital seal \" no something of yours i think colonel the top of that tony pencil case hey the colonel produced his gold pencil watched mac heat the wax drop it into the neck of the demijohn and apply the initialled end of the colonel s property while mac without any further waste of words was swinging the wicker bound temptation up on the shelf again they heard voices they re coming back says the kentuckian hurriedly \"but we ve settled our little account haven t we old man \" mac jerked his head in that automatic fashion that with him meant genial and whole hearted agreement and if potts or o flynn want to break that seal i ll call em down says mac and the colonel knew the seal was safe by the by colonel said the boy just as he was turning in that night \"i a i ve asked that jesuit chap to the house warming \" oh you did did you yes well you d just better have a talk with mac about it yes i ve been tryin to think how i d square mac of course i know i ll have to go easy on the raw i reckon you just will if monkey wrench screws down hard on me you ll come to the rescue won t you colonel no i ll side with mac on that subject whatever he says goes humph that jesuit s all right not a word out of the colonel chapter iii two new spissimens medwjedew zu luka tag mal wer bist du ich kenne dich nicht luka kennst du denn sonst alle leute medwjedew in meinem revier mu ich jeden kennen und dich kenn ich nicht luka das kommt wohl daher onkelchen da dein revier nicht die ganze erde umfasst s ist da noch ein endchen drau en geblieben one of the curious results of what is called wild life is a blessed release from many of the timidities that assail the easy liver in the centres of civilisation potts was the only one in the white camp who had doubts about the wisdom of having to do with the natives however the agreeable necessity of going to pymeut to invite nicholas to the blow out was not forced upon the boy they were still hard at it four days after the jesuit had gone his way surrounding the big cabin with a false wall that final and effectual barrier against boreas finishing touch warranted to convert a cabin so cold that it drove its inmates to drink into a dwelling where practical people without cracking a dreary joke might fitly celebrate a house warming in spite of the shortness of the days father wills s suggestion was being carried out with a gratifying success already manifest were the advantages of the stockade running at a foot s distance round the cabin to the height of the eaves made of spruce saplings not even lopped of their short bushy branches but planted close together after burning the ground cleared of snow a second visitation of mild weather and a further two days thaw made the colonel determine to fill in the space between the spruce stockade and the cabin with burnt out soil closely packed down and well tramped in it was generally conceded as the winter wore on that to this contrivance of the \"earthwork\" belonged a good half of the credit of the big cabin and its renown as being the warmest spot on the lower river that terrible memorable year of the klondyke rush the evergreen wall with the big stone chimney shouldering itself up to look out upon the frozen highway became a conspicuous feature in the landscape welcome as the weeks went on to many an eye wearied with long looking for shelter and blinded by the snow whitened waste an exception to what became a rule was of all men nicholas when the stockade was half done the prince and an equerry appeared on the horizon with the second team the camp had seen the driver much concerned to steer clear of the softened snow and keep to that part of the river ice windswept and firm if roughest of all nicholas regarded the stockade with a cold and beady eye no he hadn t time to look at it he had promised to \"mush \" he wasn t even hungry it did little credit to his heart but he seemed more in haste to leave his new friends than the least friendly of them would have expected oh wait a sec urged the deeply disappointed boy \"i wanted awf ly to see how your sled is made it s better n father wills \" humph grunted nicholas scornfully \"him no got innuit sled \" mac and i are goin to try soon s the stockade s done goo bye interrupted nicholas but the boy paid no attention to the word of farewell he knelt down in the snow and examined the sled carefully spruce runners he called out to mac \"and jee they re shod with ivory jee fastened with sinew and wooden pegs hey \" looking up incredulously at nicholas \"not a nail in the whole shebang eh \" nail says nicholas \"huh no nail \" as contemptuously as though the boy had said \"bread crumbs \" well she s a daisy when you comin back comin pretty quick goin pretty quick goo bye mush shouted nicholas to his companion and the dogs got up off their haunches but the boy only laughed at nicholas s struggles to get started he hung on to the loaded sled examining praising while the dogs after the merest affectation of trying to make a start looked round at him over their loose collars and grinned contentedly me got to mush show nex time mush what s here the boy shouted through the \"mushing\" and he tugged at the goodly load so neatly disposed under an old reindeer skin sleeping bag and lashed down with raw hide that oh that was fish \"fish got so much fish at starving pymeut you can go hauling it down river well sir we want fish we must have fish hey \" the boy appealed to the others yes r right y arre i reckon we just do but nicholas had other views no me take him he hitched his body in the direction of ikogimeut bless my soul you ve got enough there for a regiment you goin to sell him hey nicholas shook his head oh come off the roof advised the boy genially you ain t carryin it about for your health i suppose said potts the people down at ikogimeut don t need it like us we re white duffers and can t get fish through the ice you sell some of it to us but nicholas shook his head and shuffled along on his snow shoes beckoning the dog driver to follow or trade some fur fur tay suggested o flynn or for sugar said mac or for tobacco tempted the colonel and before that last word nicholas s resolve went down up at the cabin he unlashed the load and it quickly became manifest that nicholas was a dandy at driving a bargain he kept on saying shamelessly more more shuhg hey oh yes me give heap fish no nuff shuhg if it hadn t been for mac his own clear headed self again and by no means to be humbugged by any prince alive the purchase of a portion of that load of frozen fish corded up like so much wood would have laid waste the commissariat but if the white men after this passage did not feel an absolute confidence in nicholas s fairness of mind no such unworthy suspicion of them found lodgment in the bosom of the prince with the exception of some tobacco he left all his ill gotten store to be kept for him by his new friends till he should return when was that to be in five sleeps he would be back good we ll have the stockade done by then what do you say to our big chimney nicholas he emitted a scornful \"peeluck \" what our chimney no good he shrugged \"why you have so tall hole your house how you cover him up \" we don t want to cover him up humph winter fin you tall hole winter come down bring in snow drive fire out he shivered in anticipation of what was to happen \"peeluck \" the white men laughed what you up to now where you going well the fact was nicholas had been sent by his great ally the father superior of holy cross on a mission very important demanding despatch father brachet him know him heap better send nicholas when him want man go god damn quick me no stop no no stop he drew on his mittens proudly unjarred by remembrance of how his good resolution had come to grief where you off to now me ketchum father wills me give letter he tapped his deerskin covered chest \"ketchum sure fore him leave ikogimeut \" you come back with father wills nicholas nodded hooray we ll all work like sixty shouted the boy \"and by saturday that s five sleeps we ll have the wall done and the house warm and you and\" he caught himself up not thus in public would he break the news to mac \"you ll be back in time for the big blow out \" to clinch matters he accompanied nicholas from the cabin to the river trail explaining \"you savvy big feast all same indian heap good grub no prayer meetin you savvy no church this time big fire big feed all kinds apples shuhg bacon no cook him you no like he added basely truckling to the prince s peculiar taste nicholas rolled his single eye in joyful anticipation and promised faithfully to grace the scene this was all very fine but father wills the last thing at night and the first thing in the morning the boy looked the problem in the face and devised now this now that adroit and disarming fashion of breaking the news to mac but it was only when the daring giver of invitations was safely in bed and mac equally safe down in the little cabin that it seemed possible to broach the subject he devised scenes in which airily and triumphantly he introduced father wills and brought mac to the point of pining for jesuit society but these scenes were actable only under conditions of darkness and of solitude the colonel refused to have anything to do with the matter our first business as i see it is to keep peace in the camp and hold fast to a good understanding with one another it s just over little things like this that trouble begins mac s one of us father wills is an outsider i won t rile mac for the sake of any jesuit alive no sir this is your funeral and you re obliged to attend \" before three of nicholas s five sleeps were accomplished the boy began to curse the hour he had laid eyes on father wills he began even to speculate desperately on the good priest s chances of tumbling into an air hole or being devoured by a timely wolf but no life was never so considerate as that yet he could neither face being the cause of the first serious row in camp nor endure the thought of having his particular guest drat him flouted and the whole house warming turned to failure and humiliation indeed the case looked desperate only one day more now before he would appear be flouted insulted and go off wounded angry leaving the boy with an irreconciliable quarrel against mac and the house warming turned to chill recrimination and to wretchedness but until the last phantasmal hope went down before the logic of events it was impossible not to cling to the idea of melting mac s arctic heart there was still one course untried since there was so little left to do to the stockade the boy announced that he thought he d go up over the hill for a tramp gun in hand and grub in pocket he marched off to play his last trump card if he could bring home a queer enough bird or beast for the collection there was still hope to what lengths might mac not go if one dangled before him the priceless bait of a golden tipped emperor goose dressed in imperial robes of rose flecked snow or who knowing mac would not trust a xema sabinii to play the part of a white winged angel of peace failing some such heavenly messenger there was nothing for it but that the boy should face the ignominy of going forth to meet the father on the morrow and confess the humiliating truth it wasn t fair to let him come expecting hospitality and find visions arose of mac receiving the bent and wayworn missionary with the greeting \"there is no corner by the fire no place in the camp for a pander to the scarlet woman \" the thought lent impassioned fervour to the quest for goose or gull it was pretty late when he got back to camp and the men were at supper no he hadn t shot anything what s that bulging in your pocket sort o stone struck it rich don t give me any chin music boys give me tea i m dog tired but when mac got up first as usual to go down to the little cabin to wood up for the night \"i ll walk down with you says the boy though it was plain he was dead beat he helped to revive the failing fire and then dropping on the section of sawed wood that did duty for a chair with some difficulty and a deal of tugging he pulled the sort o stone\" out of the pocket of his duck shooting jacket see that he held the thing tightly clasped in his two red chapped hands mac bent down shading his eyes from the faint flame flicker what is it \"piece o tooth \" by the lord harry so it is he took the thing nearer the faint light \"fossil where d you get it \" over yonder by a little frozen river how far any more only this the boy didn t answer he went outside and returned instantly lugging in something brown and whitish weather stained unwieldy i dropped this at the door as i came along home thought it might do for the collection mac stared with all his eyes and hurriedly lit a candle the boy dropped exhausted on a ragged bit of burlap by the bunks mac knelt down opposite pouring liberal libation of candle grease on the uncouth bony mass between them part of the skull he rasped out masking his ecstasy as well as he could mastodon inquired the boy mac shook his head i ll bet my boots says mac \"it s an elephas primigenius and if i m right it s a find young man where d you stumble on him \" over yonder the boy leaned his head against the lower bunk where \"across the divide the bones have been dragged up on to some rocks i saw the end of a tusk stickin up out of the snow and i scratched down till i found \" he indicated the trophy between them on the floor tusk how long bout nine feet \"we ll go and get it to morrow \" no answer from the boy early hey well a it s a good ways what if it is oh i don t mind i d do more n that for you mac there was something unnatural in such devotion mac looked up but the boy was too tired to play the big fish any longer \"i wonder if you ll do something for me \" he watched with a sinking heart mac s sharp uprising from the worshipful attitude it was not like any other mortal s gradual many jointed getting up it was more like the sudden springing out of the big blade of a clasp knife what s your game oh i ain t got any game said the boy desperately \"or if i have there s mighty little fun in it however i don t know as i want to walk ten hours again in this kind o weather with an elephant on my back just for for the poetry o the thing \" he laid his chapped hands on the side board of the bunk and pulled himself up on his legs what s your game repeated mac sternly as the boy reached the door what s the good o talkin he answered but he paused turned and leaned heavily against the rude lintel course i know you d be shot before you d do it but what i d like would be to hear you say you wouldn t kick up a hell of a row if father wills happens in to the house warmin mac jerked his set face fire reddened towards the fossil finder and he without waiting for more simply opened the door and heavily footed it back to the big cabin next morning when mac came to breakfast he heard that the boy had had his grub half an hour before the usual time and was gone off on some tramp again mac sat and mused o flynn came in with a dripping bucket and sat down to breakfast shivering which way d he go the boy down river sure he didn t go over the divide o flynn was sure he d just been down to the water hole and in the faint light he d seen the boy far down on the river trail \"leppin\" like a hare in the direction of the roosian mission \" goin to meet a nicholas reckon so said the colonel a bit ruffled \"don t believe he ll run like a hare very far with his feet all blistered \" did you know he d discovered a fossil elephant no well he has i must light out too and have a look at it do it ll be a cheerful sort of house warming with one of you off scouring the country for more blisters and chilblains and another huntin antediluvian elephants the colonel spoke with uncommon irascibility the great feast day had certainly not dawned propitiously when breakfast was done mac left the big cabin without a word but instead of going over the divide across the treeless snow waste to the little frozen river where turned up to the pale northern dawn were lying the bones of a beast that had trampled tropic forests in that other dawn of the prime the naturalist turning his back on elephas primigenius followed in the track of the boy down the great river towards ikogimeut on the low left bank of the yukon a little camp on one side a big rock hooded with snow at right angles drawn up one on top of the other two sleds covered with reindeer skins held down by stones in the corner formed by the angle of rocks and sleds a small a tent very stained and old burning before it on a hearth of greenwood a little fire struggling with a veering wind mac had seen from far off the faint blue banners of smoke blowing now right now left then tossed aloft in the pallid sunshine he looked about sharply for the boy as he had been doing this two hours there was the jesuit bending over the fire bettering the precarious position of a saucepan that insisted on sitting lop sided looking down into the heart of coals nicholas was holding up the tent flap hello how do he sang out recognising mac the priest glanced up and nodded pleasantly two indians squatting on the other side of the fire scrambled away as the shifting wind brought a cloud of stifling smoke into their faces \"where s the boy \" demanded mac arresting the stampede nicholas s dog driver stared winked and wiped his weeping smoke reddened eyes is he in there mac looked towards the tent andrew nodded between coughs what s he doing in there call him out ordered mac he no walk mac s hard face took on a look of cast iron tragedy the wind veering round again had brought the last words to the priest on the other side of the fire oh it ll be all right by and by he said cheerfully but knocking up like that just for blisters blisters no cold and general weakness that s why we delayed without waiting to hear more mac strode over to the tent and as he went in nicholas came out no sign of the boy nobody nothing what down in the corner a small yellow face lying in a nest of fur bright dark eyes stared roundly and as mac glowered astonished at the apparition a mouth full of gleaming teeth opened smiling to say in a very small voice farva astonished as mac was disappointed and relieved all at once there was something arresting in the appeal i m not your father he said stiffly \"who re you hey you speak english \" the child stared at him fixedly but suddenly for no reason on earth it smiled again mac stood looking down at it seeming lost in thought presently the small object stirred struggled about feebly under the encompassing furs and freeing itself held out its arms the mites of hands fluttered at his sleeve and made ineffectual clutches what do you want to his own vast astonishment mac lifted the little thing out of its warm nest it was woefully thin and seemed even to his inexperience to be insufficiently clothed though the beaded moccasins on its tiny feet were new and good why you re only about as big as a minute he said gruffly \"what s the matter sick \" it suddenly struck him as very extraordinary that he should have taken up the child and how extremely embarrassing it would be if anyone came in and caught him clutching the small morsel awkwardly he fumbled with the furs preparatory to getting rid without delay of the unusual burden while he was straightening the things father wills appeared at the flap smoking saucepan in hand the instant the cold air struck the child it began to cough oh you mustn t do that said the priest to mac with unexpected severity \"kaviak must lie in bed and keep warm \" down on the floor went the saucepan the child was caught away from the surprised mac and the furs so closely gathered round the small shrunken body that there was once more nothing visible but the wistful yellow face and gleaming eyes still turned searchingly on its most recent acquaintance but the priest without so much as a glance at the new comer proceeded to feed kaviak out of the saucepan blowing vigorously at each spoonful before administering he s pretty hungry commented mac \"where d you find him \" in a little village up on the kuskoquim kaviak s an esquimaux from norton sound aren t you kaviak but the child was wholly absorbed it seemed in swallowing and staring at mac \"his family came up there from the coast in a bidarra only last summer all dead now everybody else in the village and there isn t but a handful all ailing and all hungry i was tramping across an igloo there a couple of days ago and i heard a strange little muffled sound more like a snared rabbit than anything else but the indian with me said no everybody who had lived there was dead and he was for hurrying on they re superstitious you know about a place where people have died but i crawled in and found this little thing lying in a bundle of rags with its hands bound and dried grass stuffed in its mouth it was too weak to stir or do more than occasionally to make that muffled noise that i d heard coming up through the smoke hole \" what you goin to do with him well i hardly know the sisters will look after him for a while if i get him there alive why shouldn t you kaviak supplied the answer straightway by choking and falling into an appalling fit of coughing i ve got some stuff that ll be good for that said mac thinking of his medicine chest \"i ll give you some when we get back to camp \" the priest nodded taking mac s unheard of civility as a matter of course the ice is very rough the jolting makes him cough awfully the jesuit had fastened his eyes on mac s woollen muffler which had been loosened during the ministering to kaviak and had dropped on the ground \"do you need that scarf \" he asked as though he suspected mac of wearing it for show \"because if you didn t you could wrap it round kaviak while i help the men strike camp \" and without waiting to see how his suggestion was received he caught up the saucepan lifted the flap and vanished farva remarked kaviak fixing melancholy eyes on mac i ain t your father muttered the gentleman so addressed he picked up his scarf and hung it round his own neck farva insisted kaviak they looked at each other you cold that it hey mac knelt down and pulled away the furs \"god bless me you only got this one rag on god bless me \" he pulled off his muffler and wound the child in it mummy wise round and round muttering the while in a surly way when it was half done he stopped thought profoundly with a furrow cutting deep into his square forehead between the straight brows slowly he pulled his gloves out of his pocket and turned out from each beaver gauntlet an inner mitten of knitted wool \"here he said and put both little moccasined feet into one of the capacious mittens much pleased with his ingenuity he went on winding the long scarf until the yellow little esquimaux bore a certain whimsical resemblance to one of the adorable delia robbia infants but mac s sinewy hands were exerting a greater pressure than he realized the morsel made a remonstrant squeaking and squirmed feebly oh oh too tight beg your pardon said mac hastily as though not only english but punctilious manners were understanded of kaviak he relaxed the woollen bandage till the morsel lay contented again within its folds nicholas came in for kaviak and for the furs that he might pack them both in the father s sled already the true son of the church was undoing the ropes that lashed firm the canvas of the tent where s the boy \" said mac suddenly \"the young fellow that s with us you know the one that found you that first sunday and brought you to camp where is he \" nicholas paused an instant with kaviak on his shoulder kaiomi no savvy you not seen him to day no he no up with the swaddled child he made a gesture up the river towards the white camp no he came down this morning to meet you nicholas shook his head and went on gathering up the furs as he and mac came out andrew was undoing the last fastening that held the canvas to the stakes in ten minutes they were on the trail andrew leading with father wills dogs kaviak lying in the sled muffled to the eyes still looking round out of the corners no strangely enough the kaviak eye had no corners but fixedly he stared sideways at mac farva seeming not to take the smallest notice trudged along on one side of him the priest on the other and behind came nicholas and the other indians with the second sled it was too windy to talk much even had they been inclined the only sounds were the mush mush of the drivers the grate and swish of the runners over the ice and kaviak s coughing mac turned once and frowned at him it was curious that the child seemed not to mind these menacing looks not in the smallest degree by and by the order of march was disturbed kaviak s right runner catching at some obstacle swerved and sent the sled bumping along on its side the small head of the passenger narrowly escaping the ice mac caught hold of the single tree and brought the racing dogs to an abrupt halt the priest and he righted the sled and mac straddling it tucked in a loosened end of fur when all was again in running order mac was on the same side as father wills he still wore that look of dour ill temper and especially did he glower at the unfortunate kaviak seized with a fresh fit of coughing that filled the round eyes with tears don t you get kind o tired listenin to that noise suppose i was to carry just for a bit this is the roughest place on the trail hi stop he called to andrew the priest had said nothing but divining what mac would be at he helped him to undo the raw hide lashing and when kaviak was withdrawn he wrapped one of the lighter fur things round him it was only when mac had marched off glowering still and sternly refusing to meet kaviak s tearful but grateful eyes it was only then bending over the sled and making fast the furs that father wills all to himself smiled a little it wasn t until they were in sight of the smoke from the little cabin that mac slackened his pace he had never for a moment found the trail so smooth that he could return his burden to the sled now however he allowed nicholas and the priest to catch up with him you carry him the rest of the way he commanded and set his burden in nicholas s arms kaviak was ill pleased but mac falling behind with the priest stalked on with eyes upon the ground i ve got a boy of my own he jerked out presently with the air of a man who accounts confidentially for some weakness really returned the priest \"they didn t tell me \" i haven t told them yet oh all right why is he called that heathen name kaviak oh it s the name of his tribe his people belong to that branch of the innuits known as kaviaks humph then he s only kaviak as i m maccann i suppose you ve christened him well not yet no what shall we call him what s your boy s name robert bruce they went on in silence till mac said \"it s on account of my boy i came up here \" oh it didn t use to matter if a man was poor and self taught but in these days of competition it s different a boy must have chances if he s going to fight the battle on equal terms of course some boys ain t worth botherin about but my boy well he seems to have something in him the priest listened silently but with that look of brotherliness on his face that made it so easy to talk to him it doesn t really matter to those other fellows mac jerked his hand towards the camp \"it s never so important to men who stand alone but i ve got to strike it rich over yonder \" he lifted his head and frowned defiantly in the general direction of the klondyke thirteen hundred miles away \"it s my one chance he added half to himself it means everything to bob and me education scientific education costs like thunder \" in the united states oh i mean to send my boy to the old country i want bob to be thorough the priest smiled but almost imperceptibly how old is he oh bout as old as this youngster mac spoke with calculated indifference six or thereabouts no four and a half but he s bigger of course and you can see already he s got a lot in him father wills nodded with a conviction that brought mac nearer confession than he had ever been in his life you see he said quite low and as if the words were dragged out with pincers \"the fact is my married life didn t pan out very well and i ran away from home as a little chap after a lickin and never went back but there s one thing i mean to make a success of that s my boy \" well i believe you will if you feel like that why they ve gone clean past the camp trail said mac sharply \"all but nicholas and what in thunder he s put the kid back on the sled \" yes i told my men we d be getting on but they were told to leave you the venison what you goin straight on nonsense mac interrupted and began to shout to the indians no i meant to stop just tell your friends so said the unsuspecting father \"but with a sick child \" what can you do for him that we can t and to break the journey may make a big difference we ve got some condensed milk left and ah yes but we are more accustomed to it s hardly fair to burden a neighbour no we ll be getting on if those fellers up there make a row about your bringing in a youngster he thrust out his jaw \"they can settle the account with me i ve got to do something for that cough before the kid goes on \" well said the priest and so wily are these jesuits that he never once mentioned that he was himself a qualified doctor in full and regular practice he kept his eyes on the finished stockade and the great chimney wearing majestically its floating plume of smoke hi mac called between his hands to the indians who had gone some distance ahead \"hi \" he motioned them back up the hill trail o flynn had come out of the little cabin and seemed to be laboriously trundling something along the footpath he got so excited when he heard the noise and saw the party that inadvertently he let his burden slide down the icy slope bumping and bouncing clumsily from one impediment to another faith look at im sure that fossle can t resthrain his j y at seein ye back mac it s yer elephunt i was takin him in to the sate of honour be the foir we thought it ud be a pleasant surprise fur ye sure ye r more surprised to see im leppin down the hill to meet ye like a rale irish tarrier mac was angry and didn t conceal the fact as he ran to stop the thing before it should be dashed to pieces the priest happened to glance back and saw coming slowly along the river trail a solitary figure that seemed to make its way with difficulty it looks as though you d have more than you bargained for at the house warming he said o flynn came down the hill babbling like a brook good day to ye father the blessin s o heaven on ye fur not kapin us starvin anny longer there s potts been swearin be this and be that that yourself and the little divvle wudn t be at the blow out at ahl at ahl you mean the boy hasn t come back called out mac he leaned elephas primigenius against a tuft of willow banked round with snow and turned gloomily as if to go back down the river again who s this they all stood and watched the limping traveller why it s of course i didn t know him with that thing tied over his cap and mac went to meet him the boy bettered his pace how did i miss you demanded mac well said the boy looking rather mischievous \"i can t think how it happened on the way down unless you passed when i d gone uphill a piece after some tracks i was lyin under the muff a few miles down when you came back and you well i kind o thought you seemed to have your hands full \" mac looked rigid and don t you try to chaff me sir besides the boy went on \"i couldn t cover the ground like you and father wills \" what s the matter with you oh nothin to howl about but see here mac well soon s i can walk i ll go and get you the rest o that elephant there was no more said till they got up to the others who had waited for the indians to come back and had unpacked kaviak to spare him the jolting uphill o flynn was screaming with excitement as he saw that the bundle nicholas was carrying had a head and two round eyes the saints in glory be among us what s that man alive what is it be the siven that answered mac with a proprietary air \"is a little esquimaux boy and i m bringing him in to doctor his cold \" glory be an esquimer and wid a cowld sure he can have some o my linnyeemint well y arre a boss collector mac faith ye bang the jews and me thinkin ye d be satisfied wid yer elephunt not him be the siven it s an esquimer he must have to finish off his collection wan wid the rale arctic cowld in his head and two eyes that goes snappin through ye like black torpeders two spissimens in wan day yer growin exthravagant mac why musha child if i don t think yer the dandy spissimen o the lot chapter iv the blow out how good it is to invite men to the pleasant feast comfortable as rock fireplace and stockade made the cabin now the colonel had been feeling all that morning that the official house warming was fore doomed to failure nevertheless as he was cook that week he could not bring himself to treat altogether lightly his office of master of the feast there would probably be no guests even their own little company would likely be incomplete but t here was to be a spread that afternoon \"anyways \" even had the colonel needed any keeping up to the mark the office would have been cheerfully undertaken by o flynn or by potts for whom interest in the gustatory aspect of the occasion was wholly undimmed by the threatened absence of mac and the \"little divvle \" there ll be the more for us said potts enthusiastically o flynn s argument seemed to halt upon a reservation he looked over the various contributions to the feast set out on a board in front of the water bucket and \"it s mate i m wishin fur says he we ve got fish \" that s only mate on fridays we ve had fish fur five days stiddy an befure that bacon three times a day wid sivin days to the week an not enough bacon ayther begob whin all s said and done not enough to be fillin and plenty to give us the scurrvy may the divil dance on shorrt rations no scurvy in this camp for a while yet said the colonel throwing some heavy objects into a pan and washing them vigorously round and round pitaties o flynn s eyes dwelt lovingly on the rare food \"ye ve hoarded em too long man they ve sprouted \" that won t prevent you hoggin more n your share i ll bet said potts pleasantly i don t somehow like wasting the sprouts observed the colonel anxiously \"it s such a wonderful sight something growing \" he had cut one pallid slip and held it tenderly between knife and thumb waste em with scurvy staring us in the face should think not mix em with cold potaters in a salad no make slumgullion commanded o flynn what s that quoth the colonel be the siven i only wonder i didn t think of it befure arre ye listening kentucky ye take lots o wathur an if ye want it rich ye take the wathur ye ve boiled pitaties or cabbage in a vegetable stock ye mind and ye add a little flour salt and pepper an a tomater if ye re in new york or frisco and ye boil all that together with a few fish bones or bacon rin s to make it rale tasty yes well well an that s slumgullion don t sound heady enough for a blow out said the colonel \"we ll sober up on slumgullion to morrow \" anyhow it s mate i m wishin fur sighed o flynn subsiding among the tin ware \"what s the good o the little divvle and his thramps if he can t bring home a burrud or so much as the scut iv a rabbit furr the soup \" well he s contributed a bottle of california apricots and we ll have boiled rice an punch glory be y yes answered the colonel \"i ve been thinkin a good deal about the punch \" so s myself said o flynn frankly but potts looked at the colonel suspiciously through narrowed eyes there s very little whiskey left and i propose to brew a mild bowl to hell with your mild bowls a good enough punch sah but one that that a well that the whole kit and boodle of us can drink indians and everybody you know nicholas and andrew may turn up i want you two fellas to suppoht me about this there are reasons foh it sah he had laid a hand on potts shoulder and fixed o flynn with his eye \"and\" speaking very solemnly \"yoh neither o yoh gentlemen that need mo said on the subject \" whereupon having cut the ground from under their feet he turned decisively and stirred the mush pot with a magnificent air and a newly whittled birch stick to give the big cabin an aspect of solid luxury they had spread the boy s old buffalo \"robe\" on the floor and as the morning wore on potts and o flynn made one or two expeditions to the little cabin bringing back selections out of mac s hoard \"to decorate the banquet hall as they said on the last trip potts refused to accompany his pardner no it was no good mac evidently wouldn t be back to see and the laugh would be on them takin so much trouble for nothin \" and o flynn wasn t to be long either for dinner had been absurdly postponed already when the door opened the next time it was to admit mac nicholas with kaviak in his arms o flynn gesticulating like a windmill and last of all the boy kaviak was formally introduced but instead of responding to his hosts attentions the only thing he seemed to care about or even see was something that in the hurly burly everybody else overlooked the decorations mac s stuffed birds and things made a remarkably good show but the colossal success was reserved for the minute shrunken skin of the baby white hare set down in front of the great fire for a hearthrug if the others failed to appreciate that joke not so kaviak he gave a gurgling cry struggled down out of nicholas s arms and folded the white hare to his breast where are the other indians said mac looking after the dogs said father wills and as the door opened oh yes give us that he said to andrew \"i thought\" he turned to the colonel \"maybe you d like to try some yukon reindeer \" hooray mate arre ye sayin mate or is an angel singin now i know that man s a christian soliloquised potts look here it ll take a little time to cook said mac \"and it s worth waitin for can you let us have a pail o hot water in the meantime \" y yes said the colonel looking as if he had enough to think about already yes we always wash them first of all said father wills noticing how mac held the little heathen off at arm s length \"nicholas used to help with that at holy cross \" he gave the new order with the old authoritative gesture and where s the liniment i lent you that you re so generous with mac arraigned o flynn \"go and get it \" under nicholas s hands kaviak was forced to relinquish not only the baby hare but his own elf locks he was closely sheared his moccasins put off and his single garment dragged unceremoniously wrong side out over his head and bundled out of doors be the siven he s got as manny bones as a skeleton poor little codger the colonel stood an instant skillet in hand staring what s that he s got round his neck said the boy moving nearer kaviak seeing the keen look menacing his treasure lifted a shrunken yellow hand and clasped tight the dirty shapeless object suspended from a raw hide necklace nicholas seemed to hesitate to divest him of this sole remaining possession you must get him to give it up said father wills \"and burn it \" kaviak flatly declined to fall in with as much as he understood of this arrangement what is it anyway the boy pursued his amulet i suppose as father wills proceeded to enforce his order and pulled the leather string over the child s head kaviak rent the air with shrieks and coughs he seemed to say as well as he could i can do without my parki and my mucklucks but i ll take my death without my amulet mac insinuated himself brusquely between the victim and his persecutors he took the dirty object away from the priest with scant ceremony in spite of the whisper \"infection \" and gave it back to the wrathful owner you talk his language don t you mac demanded of nicholas the pymeut pilot nodded tell him if he ll lend the thing to me to wash he shall have it back nicholas explained kaviak with streaming eyes and quivering lips reluctantly handed it over and watched mac anxiously till overwhelmed by a yet greater misfortune in the shape of a bath for himself how shall i clean this thing thoroughly mac condescended to ask father wills the priest shrugged he ll have forgotten it to morrow he shall have it to morrow said mac with his back to kaviak the boy o flynn and potts crowding round him mac ripped open the little bird skin pouch and took out three objects an ivory mannikin a crow s feather and a thing that father wills said was a seal blood plug what s it for \"same as the rest it s an amulet only as it s used to stop the flow of blood from the wound of a captive seal it is supposed to be the best of all charms for anyone who spits blood \" i ll clean em all after the blow out said mac and he went out buried the charms in the snow and stuck up a spruce twig to mark the spot meanwhile to poor kaviak it was being plainly demonstrated what an awful fate descended on a person so unlucky as to part with his amulet he stood straight up in the bucket like a champagne bottle in a cooler and he could not have resented his predicament more if he had been set in crushed ice instead of warm water under the remorseless hands of nicholas he began to splutter and choke to fizz and finally explode with astonishment and wrath it was quite clear nicholas was trying to drown him he took the treatment so to heart that he kept on howling dismally for some time after he was taken out and dried and linimented and dosed by mac whose treachery about the amulet he seemed to forgive since \"farva\" had had the air of rescuing him from the horrors he had endured in that water bucket where for all kaviak knew he might have stayed till he succumbed to death the boy contributed a shirt of his own and helped mac to put it on the incredibly thin little figure the shirt came down to kaviak s heels and had to have the sleeves rolled up every two minutes but by the time the reindeer steak was nearly done kaviak was done too and o flynn had said \"that spissimen does ye credit mac \" said spissimen was now staring hungrily out of the colonel s bunk holding towards mac an appealing hand with half a yard of shirt sleeve falling over it mac pretended not to see and drew up to the table the one remaining available thing to sit on his back to his patient when the dogs had been fed and the other indians had come in and squatted on the buffalo skin with nicholas the first course was sent round in tin cups a nondescript but warming \"camp soup \" sorry we ve got so few dishes gentlemen the colonel had said we ll have to ask some of you to wait till others have finished farva remarked kaviak leaning out of the bunk and sniffing the savoury steam he takes you for a priest said potts with the cheerful intention of stirring mac s bile but not even so damning a suspicion as that could cool the collector s kindness for his new spissimen you come here he said kaviak didn t understand the boy got up limped over to the bunk lifted the child out and brought him to mac s side since there ain t enough cups said mac in self justification and he put his own half empty to kaviak s lips the spissimen imbibed greedily audibly and beamed mac with unimpaired gravity took no notice of the huge satisfaction this particular remedy was giving his patient except to say solemnly \"don t bubble in it \" the next course was fish a la pymeut you re lucky to be able to get it said the father whether with suspicion or not no man could tell \"i had to send back for some by a trader and couldn t get enough \" we didn t see any trader said the boy to divert the current he may have gone by in the dusk he was travelling hotfoot thought that steamship was chockful o grub what did you want o fish yes they ve got plenty of food but they don t relish parting with it suggested potts they haven t much to think about except what they eat they wanted to try our fish and were ready to exchange i promised i would send a load back from ikogimeut if they d he seemed not to care to finish the sentence so you didn t do much for the pymeuts after all i did something he said almost shortly then with recovered serenity he turned to the boy \"i promised i d bring back any news \" yes well everybody stopped eating and hung on the priest s words captain rainey s heard there s a big new strike in the klondyke on the american side this time hail columbia whereabouts at a place called minook where s that up the river by the ramparts how far oh a little matter of six or seven hundred miles from here glory to god might as well be six or seven thousand and very probably isn t a bona fide strike at all said the priest but just a stampede a very different matter well i tell you straight i got no use for a gold mine in minook at this time o year nop venison steak s more in my line than grub stake just about now potts had to bestir himself and wash dishes before he could indulge in his \"line \" when the grilled reindeer did appear flanked by really truly potatoes and the colonel s hot kentucky biscuit there was no longer doubt in any man s mind but what this blow out was being a success colonel s a daisy cook ain t he the boy appealed to father wills the jesuit assented cordially my family meant me for the army he said \"seen much service colonel \" the kentuckian laughed never wasted a day soldiering in my life oh maybe you re wonderin said potts \"why he s a colonel \" the jesuit made a deprecatory gesture politely disclaiming any such rude curiosity he s from kentucky you see and the smile went round \"beyond that we can t tell you why he s a colonel unless it s because he ain t a judge \" and the boss of the camp laughed with the rest for the denver man had scored by the time they got to the california apricots and boiled rice everybody was feeling pretty comfortable when at last the table was cleared except for the granite ware basin full of punch and when all available cups were mustered and tobacco pouches came out a remarkably genial spirit pervaded the company with three exceptions potts and o flynn waited anxiously to sample the punch before giving way to complete satisfaction and kaviak was impervious to considerations either of punch or conviviality being wrapped in slumber on a corner of the buffalo skin between mac s stool and the natives who also occupied places on the floor upon o flynn s first draught he turned to his next neighbour potts me bhoy tain t s bad i ll bet five dollars it won t make yer any happier begob i m happy enough gentlemen wud ye like i should sing ye a song yes yes and the colonel thumped the table for order infinitely relieved that the dinner was done and the punch not likely to turn into a casus belli o flynn began a ditty about the widdy malone that woke up kaviak and made him rub his round eyes with astonishment he sat up and hung on to the back of mac s coat to make sure he had some anchorage in the strange new waters he had so suddenly been called on to navigate the song ended the colonel as toast master proposed the health of he was going to say father wills but felt it discreeter to name no names standing up in the middle of the cabin where he didn t have to stoop he lifted his cup till it knocked against the swing shelf and called out \"here s to our visitors neighbours and friends \" whereupon he made a stately circular bow which ended by his offering kaviak his hand in the manner of one who executes a figure in an old fashioned dance the smallest of \"our visitors still keeping hold of mac presented the colonel with the disengaged half yard of flannel undershirt on the other side and the speech went on very flowery very hospitable very kentuckian when the colonel sat down there was much applause and o flynn who had lent his cup to nicholas and didn t feel he could wait till it came back began to drink punch out of the dipper between shouts of hooray brayvo here s to the kurrnul god bless him that s rale oratry kurrnul here s to kentucky and ould ireland \" father wills stood up smiling to reply \"friends\" the boy thought the keen eyes rested a fraction of a moment longer on mac than on the rest \"i think in some ways this is the pleasantest house warming i ever went to i won t take up time thanking the colonel for the friendly sentiments he s expressed though i return them heartily i must use these moments you are good enough to give me in telling you something of what i feel is implied in the founding of this camp of yours gentlemen the few white dwellers in the yukon country have not looked forward his eyes twinkled almost wickedly \"with that pleasure you might expect in exiles to the influx of people brought up here by the great gold discovery we knew what that sort of craze leads to we knew that in a barren land like this more and more denuded of wild game every year more and more the prey of epidemic disease we knew that into this sorely tried and hungry world would come a horde of men all of them ignorant of the conditions up here most of them ill provided with proper food and clothing many of them i can say it without offence in this company many of them men whom the older richer communities were glad to get rid of gentlemen i have ventured to take you into our confidence so far because i want to take you still farther to tell you a little of the intense satisfaction with which we recognise that good fortune has sent us in you just the sort of neighbours we had not dared to hope for it means more to us than you realise when i heard a few weeks ago that in addition to the boat loads that had already got some distance up the river beyond holy cross \" going to dawson oh yes klondyke mad they ll be there before us boys anyways they ll get to minook the jesuit shook his head \"it isn t so certain they probably made only a couple of hundred miles or so before the yukon went to sleep \" then if grub gives out they ll be comin back here suggested potts \"small doubt of it agreed the priest and when i heard there were parties of the same sort stranded at intervals all along the lower river \" you sure he nodded \"and when father orloff of the russian mission told us that he was already having trouble with the two big rival parties frozen in the ice below ikogimeut \" gosh wonder if any of em were on our ship \"well gentlemen i do not disguise from you that when i heard of the large amount of whiskey the small amount of food and the low type of manners brought in by these gold seekers i felt my fears justified such men don t work don t contribute anything to the decent social life of the community don t build cabins like this when i came down on the ice the first time after you d camped and i looked up and saw your solid stone chimney\" he glanced at mac \"i didn t know what a house warming it would make but already from far off across the ice and snow that chimney warmed my heart gentlemen the fame of it has gone up the river and down the river father orloff is coming to see it next week and so are the white traders from anvik and andreiefsky for they ve heard there s nothing like it in the yukon of course i know that you gentlemen have not come to settle permanently i know that when the great white silence as they call the long winter up here is broken by the thunder of the ice rushing down to the sea you like the rest will exchange the snow fields for the gold fields and pass out of our ken now i m not usually prone to try my hand at prophecy but i am tempted to say even on our short acquaintance that i am tolerably sure that while we shall be willing enough to spare most of the new comers to the klondyke we shall grudge to the gold fields the men who built this camp and warmed this cabin \" his eye rested reflectively on mac \"i don t wish to sit down leaving an impression of speaking with entire lack of sympathy of the impulse that brings men up here for gold i believe that even with the sort in the two camps below ikogimeut drinking quarrelling and making trouble with the natives at the russian mission i believe that even with them the gold they came up here for is a symbol a fetich some of us may think when such men have it in their hands they feel dimly that they are laying tangible hold at last on some elusive vision of happiness that has hitherto escaped them behind each man braving the arctic winter up here is some hope not all ignoble some devotion not all unsanctified behind most of these men i seem to see a wife or child a parent or some dear dream that gives that man his share in the eternal hope friends we call that thing we look for by different names but we are all seekers after treasure all here have turned our backs on home and comfort hunting for the great reward each man a new columbus looking for the new world some of us looking north some south some\" he hesitated the briefest moment and then with a faint smile half sad half triumphant made a little motion of his head \"some of us looking upwards \" but quickly as though conscious that if he had raised the moral tone of the company he had not raised its spirits he hurried on \"before i sit down gentlemen just one word more i must congratulate you on having found out so soon not only the wisdom but the pleasure of looking at this arctic world with intelligent eyes and learning some of her wonderful lessons it is so that now the hardest work is finished you will keep up your spirits and avoid the disease that attacks all new comers who simply eat sleep and wait for the ice to go out when i hear cheechalkos complaining of boredom up here in this world of daily miracles i think of the native boy in the history class who called on to describe the progress of civilisation said in those days men had as many wives as they liked and that was called polygamy now they have only one wife and that s called monotony \" while o flynn howled with delight the priest wound up \"gentlemen if we find monotony up here it s not the country s fault but a defect in our own civilisation \" wherewith he sat down amid cheers now colonel is mac goin to recite some border ballads inquired the boy \"or will he make a speech or do a highland fling \" the colonel called formally upon mr maccann mac was no sooner on his legs than kaviak determined not to lose his grasp of the situation climbed upon the three legged stool just vacated and resumed his former relations with the friendly coat tail everybody laughed but mac who pretended not to know what was going on behind his back gentlemen he began harshly with the air of one about to launch a heavy indictment \"there s one element largely represented here by numbers and by interests\" he turned round suddenly toward the natives and almost swung kaviak off into space \"one element not explicitly referred to in the speeches either of welcome or of thanks but gentlemen i submit that these hitherto unrecognised natives are our real hosts and a word about them won t be out of place i ve been told to day that whether in alaska greenland or british america they call themselves innuits which means human beings they believed no doubt that they were the only ones in the world i ve been thinking a great deal about these esquimaux of late \" hear hear about their origin and their destiny mac was beginning to enjoy himself the boy was beginning to be bored and to drum softly with his fingers \"now gentlemen buffon says that the poles were the first portions of the earth s crust to cool while the equator and even the tropics of cancer and of capricorn were still too boiling hot to support life up here in the arctic regions there was a carboniferous era goin on \" where s the coal then sneered potts it s bein discovered all over ask him indicating father wills who smiled assent \"tropical forests grew where there are glayshers now and elephants and mastodons began life here \" jimminy christmas interrupted the boy sitting up very straight \"is that buffer you quoted a good authority \" first rate mac snapped out defiantly good lord then the garden o eden was up here hey course this was the cradle o the human race blow the ganges blow the nile it was our yukon that saw the first people cause of course the first people lived in the first place got ready for em that don t follow read your bible if i m not right how did it happen there were men here when the north was first discovered sh mac s got the floor shut up but the boy thumped the table with one hand and arraigned the schoolmaster with the other now mac i put it to you as a man o science if the race had got a foothold in any other part o the world what in sam hill could make em come up here we re here yes tomfools after gold they never dreamed there was gold no sir ee the only thing on earth that could make men stay here would be that they were born here and didn t know any better don t the primitive man cling to his home no matter what kind o hole it is he s afraid to leave it and these first men up here why it s plain as day they just hung on things gettin worse and worse and colder and colder and some said as the old men we laugh at say at home the climate ain t what it was when i was a boy and nobody believed em but everybody began to dress warmer and eat fat and all that buffon says is yes and they invented one thing after another to meet the new conditions kaiaks and bidarras and ivory tipped harpoons he was pouring out his new notions at the fastest express rate \"and the animals that couldn t stand it emigrated and those that stayed behind got changed \" dry up one at a time buffon yes yes mac and the hares got white and the men playin a losin game for centuries got dull in their heads and stunted in their legs always cramped up in a kaiak like those fellas at st michael s and why it s clear as crystal they re survivals the esquimaux are the oldest race in the world who s makin this speech order order well see here do you admit it mac don t you see there were just a few enterprisin ones who cleared out or maybe got carried away in a current and found better countries and got rich and civilised and became our forefathers hey boys ain t i right you sit down you ll get chucked out buffon everybody was talking at once why it goes on still the boy roared above the din \"people who stick at home and are patient and put up with things they re doomed but look at the fellas that come out o starvin attics and stinkin pigsties to america they live like lords and they look at life like men \" mac was saying a great deal about the ice age and the first and second periods of glaciation but nobody could hear what \"prince nicholas well i should smile he belongs to the oldest family in the world hoop la \" the boy jumped up on his stool and cracked his head against the roof but he only ducked rubbed his wild long hair till it stood out wilder than ever and went on \"nicholas s forefathers were kings before caesar they were here before the pyramids \" the colonel came round and hauled the boy down potts was egging the miscreant on o flynn poorly disguising his delight in a scrimmage had been shouting \"ye ll spoil the blow out ye meddlin jackass can t ye let mac make his spache no ye must ahlways be huntin round fur harrum to be doin or throuble to make \" in the turmoil and the contending of many voices nicholas began to explain to his friends that it wasn t a real fight as it had every appearance of being and the visitors were in no immediate danger of their lives but kaviak feared the worst and began to weep forlornly the world is dyin at top and bottom screamed the boy writhing under the colonel s clutch \"the ice will spread the beasts will turn white and we ll turn yella and we ll all dress in skins and eat fat and be exactly like kaviak and the last man ll be found tryin to warm his hands at the equator his feet on an iceberg and his nose in a snowstorm your old buffer s got a long head mac here s to buffer \" whereupon he subsided and drank freely of punch well said the colonel severely \"you ve had a blow out if nobody else has \" feel better inquired potts tenderly now mac you shall have a fair field said the colonel \"and if the boy opens his trap again \" i ll punch im promised o flynn replenishing the disturber s cup but mac wouldn t be drawn besides he was feeding kaviak so the colonel filled in the breach with \"my old kentucky home which he sang with much feeling if not great art this performance restored harmony and a gentle reflectiveness father wills told about his journey up here ten years before and of a further expedition he d once made far north to the koyukuk but nicholas knows more about the native life and legends than anyone i ever met except of course yagorsha \" who s yag began the boy oh that s the village story teller he was about to speak of something else but lifting his eyes he caught mac s sudden glance of grudging attention the priest looked away and went on \"there s a story teller in every settlement he has always been a great figure in the native life i believe but now more than ever \" why s that oh battles are over and blood feuds are done but the need for a story teller abides in most villages he is a bigger man than the chief they re all ol chiefs the few that are left and when they die there will be no more so the tribal story teller comes to be the most important character the jesuit smiled in that shrewd and gentle way of his \"that is of course after the sham n as the russians call him the medicine man who is a teller of stories too in his more circumscribed fashion but it s the story teller who helps his people through the long winter helps them to face the terrible new enemies epidemic disease and famine he has always been their best defence against that age old dread they all have of the dark yes no one better able to send such foes flying than yagorsha of pymeut still nicholas is a good second \" the prince of pymeut shook his head tell them the white crow s last flight urged the priest but nicholas was not in the vein and when they all urged him overmuch he in self defence pulled a knife out of his pocket and a bit of walrus ivory about the size of his thumb and fell to carving what you makin button says nicholas \"me heap hurry get him done \" it looks more like a bird than a button remarked the boy him bird him button replied the imperturbable one half the folk lore of the north has to do with the crow or raven the priest went on \"seeing kaviak s feather reminded me of a native cradle song that s a kind of a story too it s been roughly translated \" can you say it i used to know how it went he began in a deep voice \" the wind blows over the yukon my husband hunts deer on the koyukun mountains ahmi ahmi sleep little one there is no wood for the fire the stone axe is broken my husband carries the other where is the soul of the sun hid in the dam of the beaver waiting the spring time ahmi ahmi sleep little one wake not look not for ukali old woman long since the cache was emptied the crow lights no more on the ridge pole long since my husband departed why does he wait in the mountains ahmi ahmi sleep little one softly where where where is my own does he lie starving on the hillside why does he linger comes he not soon i must seek him among the mountains ahmi ahmi little one sleep sound hush hush hush the crow cometh laughing red is his beak his eyes glisten the false one \"thanks for a good meal to kuskokala the sham n on the far mountain quietly lieth your husband \" ahmi ahmi sleep little one wake not \"twenty deers tongues tied to the pack on his shoulders not a tongue in his mouth to call to his wife with wolves foxes and ravens are tearing and fighting for morsels tough and hard are the sinews not so the child in your bosom \" ahmi ahmi sleep little one wake not over the mountain slowly staggers the hunter two bucks thighs on his shoulders twenty deers tongues in his belt \"go gather wood kindle a fire old woman \" off flew the crow liar cheat and deceiver wake oh sleeper awake welcome your father he brings you back fat marrow venison fresh from the mountain tired and worn yet he s carved you a toy of the deer s horn while he was sitting and waiting long for the deer on the hillside wake see the crow hiding himself from the arrow wake little one wake here is your father safe home \" who s kuskokala the sham n the boy inquired ah better ask nicholas answered the priest but nicholas was absorbed in his carving again mr o flynn obliged roaring with great satisfaction \" i m a stout rovin blade and what matther my name for i ahlways was wild an i ll niver be tame an i ll kiss putty gurrls wheriver i go an what s that to annyone whether or no chorus \" ogedashin den thashin come boys let us drink tis madness to sorra tis folly to think for we re ahl jolly fellows wheriver we go ogedashin den thashin na boneen sheen lo \" potts was called on no he couldn t sing but he could show them a trick or two and with his grimy euchre deck he kept his word showing that he was not the mere handy man but the magician of the party the natives who know the cards as we know our a b c s were enthralled and began to look upon potts as a creature of more than mortal skill again the boy pressed nicholas to dance \"no no \" and under his breath \"you come pymeut \" meanwhile o flynn hugging the pleasant consciousness that he had distinguished himself his pardner too complained that the only contribution mac or the boy had made was to kick up a row what steps were they going to take to retrieve their characters and minister to the public entertainment i ve supplied the decorations said mac in a final tone well and the bhoy what good arre ye annyway hard to say said the person addressed but thinking hard \"would you like to see me wag my ears \" some languid interest was manifested in this accomplishment but it fell rather flat after potts splendid achievements with the euchre deck no ye ain t good fur much as an enthertainer said o flynn frankly kaviak had begun to cry for more punch and mac was evidently growing a good deal perplexed as to the further treatment for his patient did ye be tellin some wan father that when ye found that esquimer he had grass stuffed in his mouth sure he ll be missin that grass ram somethin down his throat was it done to shorten his sufferings the colonel asked in an undertone no answered the priest in the same low voice \"if they listen long to the dying the cry gets fixed in their imagination and they hear it after the death and think the spirit haunts the place their fear and horror of the dead is beyond belief they ll turn a dying man out of his own house and not by the door but through a hole in the roof or they pull out a log to make an opening closing it up quick so the spirit won t find his way back \" kaviak continued to lament sorry we can t offer you some blubber kaviak tain t that he s missin he s got an inexhaustible store of his own his mistake is offerin it to us i know what s the matter with that little shaver said the boy \"he hasn t got any stool and you keep him standin on those legs of his like matches \" let him sit on the buffalo skin there said mac gruffly don t you s pose he s thought o the buffalo skin but he d hate it a little fella likes to be up where he can see what s goin on he d feel as lost way down there on the buffalo as a puppy in a corn brake the boy was standing up looking round i know elephas come along jimmie in spite of remonstrance they rushed to the door and dragged in the \"fossle \" when nicholas and his friends realised what was happening they got up grunting and protesting \"lend a hand andrew the boy called to the man nearest no no \" objected the true son of the church with uncommon fervour you then nicholas \"oo ha oo no touch no touch \" what s up you don t know what this is huh nicholas know plenty well nicholas no touch bones of dead devils this view of the \"fossle\" so delighted the company that acting on a sudden impulse they pushed the punch bowl out of the way and with a whoop hoisted the huge thing on the table then the boy seized the whimpering kaviak and set him high on the throne so surprised was the topmost spissimen that he was as quiet for a moment as the one underneath him staring about blinking then looking down at mac s punch cup he remembered his grievance and took up the wail where he had left it off nuh nuh don t you do that said the boy with startling suddenness if you make that noise i ll have to make a worse one if you cry kaviak i ll have to sing hmt hmt don t you do it and as kaviak in spite of instructions began to bawl the boy began to do a plantation jig crooning monotonously \" grashoppah sett n on de swee p tater vine swee p tater vine swee p tater vine grasshoppah \" he stopped as suddenly as he d begun \" now will you be good \" kaviak drew a breath with a catch in it looked round and began as firmly as ever weh eh eh sh sh the boy clapped his hands and lugubriously intoned \" dey s de badger and de bah en de funny lil hah en de active lil flea en de lil armadillah dat sleeps widouter pillah an dey all gottah mate but me ee ee farva kaviak gasped say do a nigger breakdown solicited potts ain t room besides i can t do it with blisters they did the impossible they made room and turned back the buffalo skin only the big colonel who was most in the way of all sat not stirring staring in the fire such a look on the absent tender face as the great masters the divinest poets cannot often summon but which comes at the call of some foolish old nursery jingle some fragment of half forgotten folk lore heard when the world was young when all hearing was music when all sight was \"pictures when every sense brought marvels that seemed the everyday way of the wonderful wonderful world for an obvious reason it is not through the utterances of the greatest that the child receives his first intimations of the beauty and the mystery of things these come in lowly guise with familiar everyday voices but their eloquence has the incommunicable grace of infancy the promise of the first dawn the menace of the first night do you remember the thing about the screech owl and the weather signs \" said the colonel roused at last by the jig on his toes and the rattle of improvised \"bones\" almost in his face reckon i do honey said the boy his feet still flying and flapping on the hard earthen floor \" wen de screech owl light on de gable en en holler who ool oh oh \" he danced up and hooted in kaviak s face \" den yo bettah keep yo eyeball peel kase e bring bad luck t yo oh oh oh oh \" then sinking his voice dancing slowly and glancing anxiously under the table \" wen de ole black cat widdee yalla eyes slink round like she atterah mouse den yo bettah take keer yo self en frien s kase deys sholy a witch en de house \" an awful pause a shiver and a quick change of scene indicated by a gurgling whoop ending in a quacking \" wen de puddle duck e leave de pon en start t comb e fedder den yo bettah take yo omberel kase deys gwine tubbee wet wedder \" now comes the speckly rooster the colonel prompted the boy crowed long and loud \" effer ole wile rooster widder speckly tail commer crowin befoh de do en yo got some comp ny a ready yo s gwinter have some mo \" then he grunted and went on all fours \"kaviak \" he called \"you take warnin \" wen yo see a pig agoin along \" look here kaviak s never seen a pig i call it a shame \" wen yo see a pig agoin along widder straw en de sider is mouf it ll be a tuhble winter en yo bettuh move down souf \" he jumped up and dashed into a breakdown clattering the bones and screeching \" squirl he got a bushy tail possum s tail am bah raccoon s tail am ringed all roun touch him ef yo dah rabbit got no tail at all cep a little bit o bunch o hah \" the group on the floor undoubtedly liked that part of the entertainment that involved the breakdown infinitely the best of all but simultaneously at its wildest moment they all turned their heads to the door mac noticed the movement listened and then got up lifted the latch and cautiously looked out the boy caught a glimpse of the sky over mac s shoulder jimminy christmas he stopped nearly breathless \"it can t be a fire say boys they re havin a blow out up in heaven \" the company crowded out the sky was full of a palpitant light an indian appeared from round the stockade he was still staring up at the stone chimney are we on fire how do he handed father wills a piece of dirty paper hah yes all right andrew andrew needed no more he bustled away to harness the dogs the white men were staring up at the sky \"what s goin on in heaven father s pose you call this the aurora borealis hey \" yes said the priest \"and finer than we often get it we are not far enough north for the great displays \" he went in to put on his parki mac after looking out had shut the door and stayed behind with kaviak on father will s return farva speaking apparently less to the priest than to the floor muttered \"better let him stop where he is till his cold s better \" the colonel came in leave the child here ejaculated the priest till he s better able to travel why not said the colonel promptly well it would be a kindness to keep him a few days i ll have to travel fast tonight then it s settled mac bundled kaviak into the boy s bunk when the others were ready to go out again farva caught up his fur coat and went along with them the dogs were not quite ready the priest was standing a little absentmindedly looking up the pale green streamers were fringed with the tenderest rose colour and from the corona uniting them at the zenith they shot out across the heavens with a rapid circular and lateral motion paling one moment flaring up again the next wonder what makes it said the colonel electricity mac snapped out promptly the priest smiled one mystery for another he turned to the boy and they went on together preceding the others a little on the way down the trail towards the river i think you must come and see us at holy cross eh come soon and then without waiting for an answer \"the indians think these flitting lights are the souls of the dead at play but yagorsha says that long ago a great chief lived in the north who was a mighty hunter it was always summer up here then and the big chief chased the big game from one end of the year to another from mountain to mountain and from river to sea he killed the biggest moose with a blow of his fist and caught whales with his crooked thumb for a hook one long day in summer he d had a tremendous chase after a wonderful bird and he came home without it deadbeat and out of temper he lay down to rest but the sunlight never winked and the unending glare maddened him he rolled and tossed and roared as only the yukon roars when the ice rushes down to the sea but he couldn t sleep then in an awful fury he got up seized the day in his great hands tore it into little bits and tossed them high in the air so it was dark and winter fell on the world for the first time during months and months just to punish this great crime there was no bright sunshine but often in the long night while the chief was wearying for summer to come again he d be tantalised by these little bits of the broken day that flickered in the sky coming andrew \" he called back the others trooped down hill dogs sleds and all there was a great hand shaking and good byeing nicholas whispered you come pymeut i should just pretty nearly think i would you dance heap good buttons no all done he put four little ivory crows into the boy s hands they were rudely but cleverly carved with eyes outlined in ink and supplied under the breast with a neat inward cut shank mighty fine the boy examined them by the strange glow that brightened in the sky you keep oh no can t do that yes nicholas spoke peremptorily \"yukon men have big feast must bring present me no got reindeer me got button \" he grinned goo bye and the last of the guests went his way it was only habit that kept the colonel toasting by the fire before he turned in for the cabin was as warm to night as the south in mid summer \"grasshoppah sett n on a swee p tater vine the boy droned sleepily as he untied the leathern thongs that kept up his muckluck legs swee p tater vine swee p ta \" all those othahs the colonel waved a hand in the direction of pymeut \"i think we dreamed em boy you and me playing the big game with fohtune foolishness klondyke yoh crazy tell me the river s hard as iron and the snow s up to the windah don b lieve a wo d of it we re on some plantation boy down south in the niggah quawtaws \" the boy was turning back the covers and balancing a moment on the side of the bunk \"sett n on a swee p tater vine swee p ta \" great caesar s ghost he jumped up and stood staring down at the sleeping kaviak ah a didn t you know he s been left behind for a few days yes i can see he s left behind no colonel i reckon we re in the arctic regions all right when it comes to catchin esquimers in your bed he pulled the furs over kaviak and himself and curled down to sleep chapter v the sham n for my part i have ever believed and do now know that there are witches religio medici the boy had hoped to go to pymeut the next day but his feet refused to carry him mac took a diagram and special directions and went after the rest of elephas conveying the few clumsy relics home bit by bit with a devotion worthy of a pious pilgrim for three days the boy growled and played games with kaviak going about at first chiefly on hands and knees on the fifth day after the blow out \"you comin long to pymeut this mornin \" he asked the colonel what s the rush rush good lord it s most a week since they were here and it s stopped snowin and hasn t thought of sleetin yet or anything else rambunksious come on colonel but father wills had shown the colonel the piece of dirty paper the indian had brought on the night of the blow out trouble threatened pymeuts think old chief dying not of consumption but of a devil they ve sent a dogteam to bring the sham n down over the ice come quickly paul reckon we d better hold our horses till we hear from holy cross hear what the colonel didn t answer but the boy didn t wait to listen he swallowed his coffee scalding hot rolled up some food and stuff for trading in a light reindeer skin blanket lashed it packwise on his back shouldered his gun and made off before the trio came in to breakfast the first sign that he was nearing a settlement was the appearance of what looked like sections of rude wicker fencing set up here and there in the river and frozen fast in the ice high on the bank lay one of the long cornucopia shaped basket fish traps and presently he caught sight of something in the bleak arctic landscape that made his heart jump something that to florida eyes looked familiar why if it doesn t make me think of john fox s cabin on cypress creek he said to himself formulating an impression that had vaguely haunted him on the lower river in september wondering if the yukon flooded like the caloosahatchee and if the water could reach as far up as all that he stopped to have a good look at this first one of the pymeut caches for this modest edifice like a noah s ark on four legs was not a habitation but a storehouse and was perched so high not for fear of floods but for fear of dogs and mice this was manifest from the fact that there were fish racks and even ighloos much nearer the river the boy stopped and hesitated it was a sore temptation to climb up and see what they had in that cache there was an inviting plank all ready with sticks nailed on it transversely to prevent the feet from slipping but the boy stopped at the rude ladder s foot deciding that this particular mark of interest on the part of a stranger might be misinterpreted it would perhaps be prudent to find nicholas first of all but where was nicholas where was anybody the scattered half buried huts were more like earth mounds snow encrusted some with drift logs propped against the front face looking riverwards while he was cogitating how to effect an entrance to one of these or to make his presence known he saw to his relief the back of a solitary indian going in the direction of an ighloo farther up the river hi hi he shouted and as the figure turned he made signs it stopped how do the boy called out when he got nearer \"you talk english \" the native laughed a flash of fine teeth and sparkling eyes lit up a young good looking face this boy seemed promising how d ye do you know nicholas yes the laugh was even gayer it seemed to be a capital joke to know nicholas where is he the figure turned and pointed and then \"come i show you \" this was a more highly educated person than nicholas thought the visitor remarking the use of the nominative scorned of the prince they walked on to the biggest of the underground dwellings is this where the king hangs out nicholas father lives here no this is the kazhga oh the kachime ain t you comin in oh no why his guide had a fit of laughter and then turned to go say what s your name the answer sounded like \"muckluck \" and just then nicholas crawled out of the tunnel like opening leading into the council house he jumped up beaming at the sight of his friend say nicholas who s this fella that s always laughing no matter what you say calls himself muckluck the individual referred to gave way to another spasm of merriment which infected nicholas my sister this one he explained oh h the boy joined in the laugh and pulled off his arctic cap with a bow borrowed straight from the colonel princess muckluck i m proud to know you name no muckluck began nicholas \"name mahk \" mac nonsense mac s a man s name she s princess muckluck only how s a fella to tell when you dress her like a man the princess still giggled while her brother explained no like man see he showed how the skirt of her deerskin parki reaching like her brother s a little below the knee was shaped round in front and nicholas s own all men s parkis were cut straight across i see how s your father nicholas looked grave even princess muckluck stopped laughing come said nicholas and the boy followed him on all fours into the kachime entering on his stomach he found himself in a room about sixteen by twenty feet two thirds underground log walls chinked with moss a roof of poles sloping upwards tent like but leaving an opening in the middle for a smoke hole some three feet square and covered at present by a piece of thin translucent skin with the sole exception of the smoke hole the whole thing was so covered with earth and capped with snow that expecting a mere cave one was surprised at the wood lining within the boy was still more surprised at the concentration there of malignant smells he gasped and was for getting out again as fast as possible when the bearskin flap fell behind him over the kachime end of the entrance tunnel through the tobacco smoke and the stifling air he saw vaguely a grave gathering of bucks sitting or rather lounging and squatting on the outer edge of the wide sleeping bench that ran all round the room about a foot and a half from the hewn log floor their solemn intent faces were lit grotesquely by the uncertain glow of two seal oil lamps mounted on two posts planted one in front of the right sleeping bench the other on the left the boy hesitated was it possible he could get used to the atmosphere certainly it was warm in here though there was no fire that he could see nicholas was talking away very rapidly to the half dozen grave and reverend signiors they punctuating his discourse with occasional grunts and a well nigh continuous coughing nicholas wound up in english me tell you he heap good friend you ketch um tobacco he inquired suddenly of his guest fortunately the boy had remembered to \"ketch\" that essential and his little offering was laid before the council men more grunts and room made for the visitor on the sleeping bench next the post that supported one of the lamps a clay saucer half full of seal oil in which a burning wick of twisted moss gave forth a powerful odour a fair amount of smoke and a faint light the boy sat down still staring about him taking note of the well hewn logs and of the neat attachment of the timbers by a saddle joint at the four corners of the roof who built this he inquired of nicholas ol father an heap ol men gone dead gee well whoever did it was on to his job he said \"i don t seen a nail in the whole sheebang \" no no nail the boy remembered nicholas s sled and looking again at the disproportionately small hands of the men about him corrected his first impression that they were too feminine to be good for much a dirty old fellow weak and sickly in appearance began to talk querulously all the others listened with respect smoking and making inarticulate noises now and then when that discourse was finished a fresh one was begun by yet another coughing councillor what s it all about the boy asked ol chief heap sick said the buck on the boy s right ol chief ol father b long me nicholas observed with pride yes but aren t the holy cross people nursing him brother paul gone white medicine no good they all shook their heads and coughed despairingly then try s m other some yella brown esquimaux kind hazarded the boy lightly hardly noticing what he was saying till he found nearly all the eyes of the company fixed intently upon him nicholas was translating and it was clear the boy had created a sensation father wills no like said one buck doubtfully \"he make cross eyes when sham n come \" oh yes medicine man said the boy following the narrative eagerly sham n go way volunteered an old fellow who hitherto had held his peace \"all get sick\" he coughed painfully \"heap pymeuts die \" father wills come nicholas took up the tale afresh \"sham n come father wills heap mad he no let sham n stay \" no him say go plenty quick plenty far hey you mush they smoked awhile in silence broken only by coughs sham n say yukon inua plenty mad who is yukon inua where does he live unner yukon ice whispered nicholas \"oh the river spirit of course \" him heap strong long time he motioned back into the ages with one slim brown hand \"fore holy cross here yukon inua take good care pymeuts \" no tell father wills no then in a low guttural voice \"sham n come again \" gracious when to night jiminny christmas they sat and smoked and coughed by and by as if wishing thoroughly to justify their action nicholas resumed you savvy ol father try white medicine four winter four summer no good ol father say me well man good friend holy cross good friend russian mission me ol me sick send for sham n the entire company grunted in unison you no tell nicholas added with recurrent anxiety no no they shan t hear through me i m safe presently they all got up and began removing and setting back the hewn logs that formed the middle of the floor it then appeared that underneath was an excavation about two feet deep in the centre within a circle of stones were the charred remains of a fire and here they proceeded to make another as soon as it began to blaze yagorsha the story teller took the cover off the smoke hole so the company was not quite stifled a further diversion was created by several women crawling in bringing food for the men folk in old lard cans or native wooden kantaks these vessels they deposited by the fire and with an exchange of grunts went out as they had come nicholas wouldn t let the boy undo his pack no we come back he said adding something in his own tongue to the company and then crawled out followed by the boy their progress was slow for the boy s \"canadian webfeet\" had been left in the kachime and he sank in the snow at every step twice in the dusk he stumbled over an ighloo or a sled or some sign of humanity and asked of the now silent preoccupied nicholas \"who lives here \" the answer had been \"nobody all dead \" the boy was glad to see approaching at last a human figure it came shambling through the snow with bent head and swaying jerking gait looked up suddenly and sheered off flitting uncertainly onward in the dim light like a frightened ghost who is that sham n him see in dark all same owl him know you white man the boy stared after him the bent figure of the sham n looked like a huge bat flying low hovering disappearing into the night those your dogs howling the visitor asked thinking that for sheer dismalness pymeut would be hard to beat nicholas stopped suddenly and dropped down the ground seemed to open and swallow him the boy stooped and saw his friend s feet disappearing in a hole he seized one of them \"hold on wait for me \" nicholas kicked but to no purpose he could make only such progress as his guest permitted presently a gleam nicholas had thrust away the flap at the tunnel s end and they stood in the house of the chief of the pymeuts that native of whom father wills had said \"he is the richest and most intelligent man of his tribe \" the single room seemed very small after the spaciousness of the kachime but it was the biggest ighloo in the settlement a fire burnt brightly in the middle of the earthen floor and over it was bending princess muckluck cooking the evening meal she nodded and her white teeth shone in the blaze over in the corner wrapped in skins lay a man on the floor groaning faintly the salmon toasting on sticks over wood coals smelt very appetising why your fish are whole don t you clean em first asked the visitor surprised out of his manners no said nicholas \"him better no cut \" they sat down by the fire and the princess waited on them the boy discovered that it was perfectly true yukon salmon broiled in their skins over a birch fire are the finest eating in the world and any other way involves a loss of flavour he was introduced for the first time to the delights of reindeer back fat and found even that not so bad you are lucky nicholas to have a sister such a nice one too the princess giggled \"to keep house for you \" nicholas understood at least that politeness was being offered and he grinned i ve got a sister myself i ll show you her picture some day i care about her a lot i ve come up here to make a pile so that we can buy back our old place in florida he said this chiefly to the princess for she evidently had profited more by her schooling and understood things quite like a christian did you ever eat an orange princess he continued kind o fish no fruit a yella ball that grows on a tree me know said nicholas \"me see him in boxes st michael s him bully \" yes well we had a lot of trees all full of those yella balls and we used to eat as many as we liked we don t have much winter down where i live summer pretty nearly all the time i d like go there said the girl well will you come and see us muckluck when i ve found a gold mine and have bought back the orange grove my sister and me are goin to live together like you and nicholas she look like you no and it s funny too cause we re twins twins what s twins two people born at the same time no ejaculated nicholas why yes and they always care a heap about each other when they re twins but muckluck stared incredulously two at the same time she exclaimed \"it s like that then in your country \" the boy saw not astonishment alone but something akin to disgust in the face of the princess he felt vaguely he must justify his twinship of course there s nothing strange about it it happens quite often often yes people are very much pleased once in a while there are even three all at the same time her horror turned into shrieks of laughter why your women are like our dogs human beings and seals never have more than one at a time the old man in the corner began to moan and mutter feverishly nicholas went to him bent down and apparently tried to soothe him muckluck gathered up the supper things and set them aside you were at the holy cross school asked the boy six years with mother aloysius and the sisters they very good so you re a catholic then oh yes you speak the best english i ve heard from a native i love sister winifred i want to go back unless she regarded the boy with a speculative eye \"unless i go your country \" the sick man began to talk deliriously and lifted up a terrible old face with fever bright eyes glaring through wisps of straight gray hair no voice but his was heard for some time in the ighloo then \"i fraid said muckluck crouching near the fire but with head turned over shoulder staring at the sick man no wonder said the boy thinking such an apparition enough to frighten anybody nicholas fraid too she whispered when the devil talks \" the devil yes sh you hear the delirious chatter went on rising to a scream nicholas came hurrying back to the fire with a look of terror in his face me go get sham n no he come soon muckluck clung to him they both crouched down by the fire you fraid he ll die before the sham n gets here oh no said muckluck soothingly but her face belied her words the sick man called hoarsely nicholas got him some water and propped him up to drink he glared over the cup with wild eyes his teeth chattering against the tin the boy himself felt a creep go down his spine muckluck moved closer to him mustn t say he die she whispered \"if nicholas think he die he drag him out leave him in the snow \" \"never \" sh she made him a sign to be quiet the rambling fever talk went on nicholas listening fascinated \"no pymeut she whispered like live in ighloo any more if man die there \" you mean if they know a person s dying they haul him out o doors and leave him a night like this if not how get him out after why carry him out touch him touch dead man she shuddered \"oh no bad bad i no think he die she resumed raising her voice but nicholas rejoined them silent looking very grave was he contemplating turning the poor old fellow out the boy sat devising schemes to prevent the barbarism should it come to that the wind had risen it was evidently going to be a rough night with imagination full of sick people turned out to perish the boy started up as a long wail came muffled but keen still with anguish down through the snow and the earth by way of the smoke hole into the dim little room oh nicholas what was that \" what wait listen there that why it s a child crying no him ch e let s go and bring him in bring dog in here dog that s no dog yes him dog him my ch e making a human noise like that nicholas nodded the only sounds for some time were the doleful lamenting of the mahlemeut without and the ravings of the pymeut chief within the boy was conscious of a queer dream like feeling all this had been going on up here for ages it had been like this when columbus came over the sea all the world had changed since then except the steadfast north the boy sat up suddenly and rubbed his eyes with that faculty on the part of the unlearned that one is tempted to call american a faculty for assimilating the grave conclusions of the doctors and importing them light heartedly into personal experience he realised that what met his eyes here in nicholas house was one of the oldest pictures humanity has presented this was what was going on by the yukon when king john beside that other river was yielding magna charta to the barons while the caesars were building rome the pymeut forefathers were building just such ighloos as this while pheidias wrought his marbles the men up here carved walrus ivory and in lieu of homer recited \"the crow s last flight\" and \"the legend of the northern lights \" nicholas had risen again his mouth set hard his small hands shaking he unrolled an old reindeer skin full of holes and examined it at this the girl who had been about to make up the fire threw down the bit of driftwood and hid her face the sick man babbled on faint under the desolate sound another sibilant clearer uncannily human nicholas had heard too for he threw down the tattered deerskin and went to the other side of the fire voices in the tunnel nicholas held back the flap and gravely waited there till one pymeut after another crawled in they were the men the boy had seen at the kachime with one exception a vicious looking old fellow thin wiry with a face like a smoked chimpanzee and eyes of unearthly brightness he was given the best place by the fire and held his brown claws over the red coals while the others were finding their places the boy feeling he would need an interpreter signed to muckluck to come and sit by him grave as a judge she got up and did as she was bid that the sham n whispered the boy she nodded it was plain that this apparition however hideous had given her great satisfaction any more people coming got no more now in pymeut where is everybody some sick some dead the old chief rambled on but not so noisily see whispered muckluck \"devil fraid already he begin to speak small \" the sham n never once looked towards the sufferer till he himself was thoroughly warm even then he withdrew from the genial glow only to sit back humped together blinking silent the boy began to feel that if he did finally say something it would be as surprising as to hear an aged monkey break into articulate speech nicholas edged towards the sham n presenting something in a birch bark dish what s that a deer s tongue whispered muckluck the boy remembered the koyukun song \"thanks for a good meal to kuskokala the sham n \" nicholas seemed to be haranguing the sham n deferentially but with spirit he pulled out from the bottom of his father s bed three fine marten skins shook them and dangled them before the sham n they produced no effect he then took a box of matches and a plug of the boy s tobacco out of his pocket and held the lot towards the sham n seeming to say that to save his life he couldn t rake up another earthly thing to tempt his sham nship although the sham n took the offerings his little black eyes glittered none the less rapaciously as they flew swiftly round the room falling at last with a vicious snap and gleam upon the boy then it was that for the first time he spoke nuh nuh interrupted muckluck chattering volubly and evidently commending the boy to the sham n several of the old bucks laughed he say yukon inua no like you he think white men bring plague bring devils got some money whispered muckluck not here the boy saw the moment when he would be turned out he plunged his hands down into his trousers pockets and fished up a knife his second best one fortunately tell him i m all right and he can give this to yukon inua with my respects muckluck explained and held up the shining object blades open corkscrew curling attractively before the covetous eyes of the sham n when he could endure the temptation no longer his two black claws shot out but nicholas intercepted the much envied object while as it seemed he drove a more advantageous bargain terms finally settled the sham n seized the knife shut it secreted it with a final grunt and stood up everyone made way for him he jerked his loosely jointed body over to the sick man lifted the seal oil lamp with his shaky old hands and looked at the patient long and steadily when he had set the lamp down again with a grunt he put his black thumb on the wick and squeezed out the light when he came back to the fire which had burnt low he pulled open his parki and drew out an ivory wand and a long eagle s feather with a fluffy white tuft of some sort at the end he deposited these solemnly side by side on the ground about two feet apart turning round to the dying fire he took a stick and with nicholas s help gathered the ashes up and laid them over the smouldering brands the ighloo was practically dark no one dared speak save the yet unabashed devil in the sick man who muttered angrily it was curious to see how the coughing of the others which in the kachime had been practically constant was here almost silenced whether this was achieved through awe and respect for the sham n or through nervous absorption in the task he had undertaken who shall say the boy felt rather than saw that the sham n had lain down between the ivory wand and the eagle s feather each man sat as still as death listening staring waiting presently a little jet of flame sprang up out of the ashes the sham n lifted his head angrily saw it was no human hand that had dared turn on the light growled and pulled something else from under his inexhaustible parki the boy peered curiously the sham n seemed to be shutting out the offensive light by wrapping himself up in something head and all what s he doing now the boy ventured to whisper under cover of the devil s sudden loud remonstrance the sick man at this point breaking into ghastly groans he puts on the kamlayka sh the sham n still enveloped head and body began to beat softly keeping time with the eagle s feather you could follow the faint gleam of the ivory wand but on what it fell with that hollow sound no eye could see now at intervals he uttered a cry a deep bass danger note singularly unnerving someone answered in a higher key and they kept this up in a kind of rude sharply timed duet till one by one the whole group of natives was gathered into the swing of it swept along involuntarily it would seem by some magnetic attraction of the rhythm \"ung hi yah ah ha yah yah yah yah \" was the chorus to that deep recurrent cry of the sham n its accompanying drum note was muffled like far off thunder conjured out of the earth by the ivory wand presently a scream of terror from the bundle of skins and bones in the corner ha muckluck clasped her hands and rocked back and forth they ll frighten the old man to death if he s conscious said the boy half rising she pulled him down no no frighten devil she was shaking with excitement and with ecstacy the sick man cried aloud a frenzy seemed to seize the sham n he raised his voice in a series of blood curdling shrieks then dropped it moaning whining then bursting suddenly into diabolic laughter bellowing whispering ventriloquising with quite extraordinary skill the dim and foetid cave might indeed be full of devils if the hideous outcry slackened but an instant you heard the sick man raving with the preternatural strength of delirium or of mad resentment for some time it seemed a serious question as to who would come out ahead just as you began to feel that the old chief was at the end of his tether and ready to give up the ghost the sham n rising suddenly with a demoniac yell flung himself down on the floor in a convulsion his body writhed horribly he kicked and snapped and quivered the boy was for shielding muckluck from the crazy flinging out of legs and arms but she leaned over breathless to catch what words might escape the sham n during the fit for these were omens of deep significance when at last the convulsive movements quieted and the sham n lay like one dead except for an occasional faint twitch the boy realised for the first time that the sick man too was dumb dead the only sound now was the wind up in the world above even the dog was still the silence was more horrible than the hell let loose of a few minutes before the dim group sat there motionless under the spell of the stillness even more than they had been under the spell of the noise at last a queer indescribable scratching and scraping came up out of the bowels of the earth how does the old devil manage to do that thought the boy but the plain truth was that his heart was in his mouth for the sound came from the opposite direction behind the boy and not near the sham n at all it grew louder came nearer more inexplicable more awful he felt he could not bear it another minute sprang up and stood there tense waiting for what might befall were all the others dead then not a sound in the place only that indescribable stirring of something in the solid earth under his feet the sham n had his knife a ghastly sensation of stifling came over the boy as he thought of a struggle down there under the earth and the snow on came the horrible underground thing desperately the boy stirred the almost extinct embers with his foot and a faint glow fell on the terror frozen faces of the natives fell on the bear skin flap it moved a huge hand came stealing round a hand the skeleton of a hand white ghastly with fingers unimaginably long no mortal in pymeut had a hand like that no mortal in all the world a crisp smart sound and a match blazed a tall lean figure rose up from behind the bear skin and received the sudden brightness full in his face pale and beautiful but angry as an avenging angel s for an instant the boy still thought it a spectre the delusion of a bewildered brain till the girl cried out \"brother paul \" and fell forward on the floor hiding her face in her hands light make a light he commanded nicholas got up dazed but obedient and lit the seal oil lamp the voice of the white man the call for light reached the sham n he seemed to shiver and shrink under the folds of the kamlayka but instead of getting up and looking his enemy in the face he wriggled along on his belly still under cover of the kamlayka till he got to the bear skin pushed it aside with a motion of the hooded head and crawled out like some snaky symbol of darkness and superstition fleeing before the light brother paul sobbed the girl \"don t don t tell sister winifred \" he took no notice of her bending down over the motionless bundle in the corner you ve killed him i suppose brother paul began nicholas faltering oh i heard the pandemonium he lifted his thin white face to the smoke hole \"it s all useless useless i might as well go and leave you to your abominations but instead go you all of you go \" he flung out his long arms and the group broke and scuttled huddling near the bear skin fighting like rats to get out faster than the narrow passage permitted the boy turned from watching the instantaneous flight the scuffle and the disappearance to find the burning eyes of the jesuit fixed fascinated on his face if brother paul had appeared as a spectre in the ighloo it was plain that he looked upon the white face present at the diabolic rite as dream or devil the boy stood up the lay brother started and crossed himself in christ s name what who are you i a i come from the white camp ten miles below and you were here you allowed this ah h he flung up his arms the pale lips moved convulsively but no sound came forth i you think i ought to have interfered began the boy i think the brother began bitterly checked himself knelt down and felt the old man s pulse nicholas at the bear skin was making the boy signs to come the girl was sobbing with her face on the ground again nicholas beckoned and then disappeared there seemed to be nothing to do but to follow his host when the bear skin had dropped behind the boy and he crawled after nicholas along the dark passage he heard the muffled voice of the girl praying \"oh mary mother of god don t let him tell sister winifred \" chapter vi a penitential journey \" certain london parishes still receive per annum for fagots to burn heretics \" john richard green the boy slept that night in the kachime beside a very moody restless host yagorsha dispensed with the formality of going to bed and seemed bent on doing what he could to keep other people awake he sat monologuing under the seal lamp till the boy longed to throw the dish of smouldering oil at his head but strangely enough when through sheer fatigue his voice failed and his chin fell on his broad chest a lad of fourteen or so who had also had difficulty to keep awake would jog yagorsha s arm repeating interrogatively the last phrase used whereon the old story teller would rouse himself and begin afresh with an iteration of the previous statement if the lad failed to keep him going one or other of the natives would stir uneasily lift a head from under his deerskin and remonstrate yagorsha opening his eyes with a guilty start would go on with the yarn when morning came and the others waked yagorsha and the lad slept nicholas and all the rest who shared the bench at night and the fire in the morning seemed desperately depressed and glum a heavy cloud hung over pymeut for pymeut was in disgrace about sunset the women came in with the kantaks and the lard cans yagorsha sat up and rubbed his eyes he listened eagerly while the others questioned the women the old chief wasn t dead at all no he was much better brother paul had been about to all the house bound sick people and given everybody medicine and flour and a terrible scolding oh yes he was angrier than anybody had ever been before some natives from the school at holy cross were coming for him tomorrow and they were all going down river and across the southern portage to the branch mission at kuskoquim down river sure yes sure brother paul had not waited to come with those others being so anxious to bring medicine and things to ol chief quick and this was how he was welcomed back to the scene of his labours a devil s dance was going on that was what he called it you savvy said nicholas to his guest \"brother paul go plenty soon you wait \" i ll have company back to camp was the boy s first thought and then would there be any fun in that after all it was plain brother paul was no such genial companion as father wills and so it was that he did not desert nicholas although brother paul s companions failed to put in an appearance on the following morning however on the third day after the incident of the sham n who seemed to have vanished into thin air brother paul shook the snow of pymeut from his feet and with three indians from the holy cross school and a dog team he disappeared from the scene not till he had been gone some time did nicholas venture to return to the parental roof they found muckluck subdued but smiling and the old man astonishingly better it looked almost as if he had turned the corner and was getting well there was certainly something very like magic in such a recovery but it was quickly apparent that this aspect of the case was not what occupied nicholas as he sat regarding his parent with a keen and speculative eye he asked him some question and they discussed the point volubly muckluck following the argument with close attention presently it seemed that father and son were taking the guest into consideration muckluck also turned to him now and then and by and by she said \"i think he go \" go where holy cross said the old man eagerly brother paul nicholas explained \"he go down river we get holy cross more quick \" i see before he can get back but why do you want to go see father brachet sister winifred say always tell father brachet then everything all right contributed muckluck you tell pymeut belly solly the old chief said nicholas know he not able tell all like white man muckluck continued \"nicholas say you good hey you good \" well a pretty tollable thank you you go with nicholas you make father brachet unnerstan forgive tell sister winifred she stopped perplexed vaguely distrustful at the boy s chuckling you think we can explain it all away hey he made a gesture of happy clearance \"sham n and everything hey \" me no can returned nicholas with engaging modesty \" you \" he conveyed a limitless confidence well i ll be jiggered if i don t try how far is it go slow one sleep well we won t go slow we ve got to do penance when shall we start too late now tomalla said the ol chief they got up very early it seemed to the boy like the middle of the night stole out of the dark kachime and hurried over the hard crust that had formed on the last fall of snow down the bleak dim slope to the ol chief s where they were to breakfast not only muckluck was up and doing but the ol chief seemed galvanised into unwonted activity he was doddering about between his bed and the fire laying out the most imposing parkis and fox skins fur blankets and a pair of seal skin mittens all of which apparently he had had secreted under his bed or between it and the wall they made a sumptuous breakfast of tea the last of the bacon the boy had brought and slapjacks the boy kept looking from time to time at the display of furs father wills was right he ought to buy a parki with a hood but he had meant to have the priest s advice or mac s at least before investing ol chief watching him surreptitiously and seeing he was no nearer making an offer felt he should have some encouragement he picked up the seal skin mittens and held them out present said ol chief \"you tell father brachet us belly solly \" oh i ll handle him without gloves said the boy giving back the mittens but ol chief wouldn t take them he was holding up the smaller of the two parkis you no like oh very nice you no buy you go sleep on trail said nicholas rising briskly \"you die no parki \" the boy laughed and shook his head but still ol chief held out the deer skin shirt and caressed the wolf fringe of the hood him cheap how cheap twenty fi dollah don t know as i call that cheap yes said nicholas \"st michael him fifty dollah \" the boy looked doubtful i saw a parki there at the a c store about like this for twenty a c parki peeluck nicholas said contemptuously then patting the one his father held out \"you wear him fifty winter \" lord forbid anyhow i ve only got about twenty dollars worth of tobacco and stuff along with me me come white camp nicholas volunteered \"me get more fi dollah \" oh will you now that s very kind of you but nicholas impervious to irony held out the parki the boy laughed and took it nicholas stooped picked up the fur mittens and laying them on the boy s arm reiterated his father s \"present \" and then departed to the kachime to bring down the boy s pack the princess meanwhile had withdrawn to her own special corner where in the daytime appeared only a roll of plaited mats and a little cheap old hat box which she evidently prized most of all she had in the world you see lock the boy expressed surprise and admiration no really i call that fine i got present for father brachet and turning over the rags and nondescript rubbish of the hat box she produced an object whose use was not immediately manifest a section of walrus ivory about six inches long had been cut in two one of these curved halves had been mounted on four ivory legs in the upper flat side had been stuck at equal distances from the two ends and from each other two delicate branches of notched ivory standing up like horns between these sat an ivory mannikin about three inches long with a woeful countenance and with arms held out like one beseeching mercy it s fine said the boy \"but a what s it for just look pretty \" wait i show you she dived into the hat box and fished up a bit of battered pencil with an air of pride she placed the pencil across the outstretched hands of the ivory suppliant asking the boy in dumb show was not this a pen rest that might be trusted to melt the heart of the holy father this way too she illustrated how anyone embarrassed by the possession of more than one pencil could range them in tiers on the ivory horns above the head of the woeful one i call that scrumptious and he looks as if he was saying he was sorry all the time she nodded delighted that the boy comprehended the subtle symbolism one more she said showing her dazzling teeth like a child playing a game she half shut the hat box and hugged it lovingly then with eyes sparkling slowly the small hand crept in was thrust down the side and drew out with a rapturous \"ha \" a gaudy advertisement card setting forth the advantages of smoking \"kentucky leaf\" she looked at it fondly then slowly regretfully all the fun gone now she passed it to the boy for sister winifred she said like one who braces herself to make some huge renunciation \"you tell her i send with my love and i always say my prayers i very good hey you tell sister winifred \" sure said the boy the ol chief was pulling the other parki over his head nicholas reappeared with the visitor s effects under the boy s eyes he calmly confiscated all the tea and tobacco but nothing had been touched in the owner s absence look here just leave me enough tea to last till i get home i ll make it up to you nicholas after some reflection agreed then he bustled about gathered together an armful of things and handed the boy a tea kettle and an axe you bring dogs all ready mush and he was gone to the boy s surprise while he and muckluck were getting the food and presents together the lively ol chief so lately dying made off in a fine new parki on all fours curious no doubt to watch the preparations without but not a bit of it the ol chief s was a more intimate concern in the expedition when the boy joined him there he was sitting up in nicholas s sled appallingly emaciated but brisk as you please ordering the disposition of the axe and rifle along either side the tea kettle and grub between his feet showing how the deer skin blankets should be wrapped and especially was he dictatorial about the lashing of the mahout how far s he comin asked the boy astonished all the way said muckluck \"he want to be sure \" several bucks came running down from the kachime and stood about coughed and spat and offered assistance or advice when at last ol chief was satisfied with the way the raw walrus hide was laced and lashed nicholas cracked his whip and shouted \"mush god damn mush \" good bye princess we ll take care of your father though i m sure he oughtn t to go oh yes answered muckluck confidently then lower \"sham n make all well quick hey goo bye \" good bye don t forget tell sister winifred i say my p but the boy had to run to keep up with the sled for some time he kept watching the ol chief with unabated astonishment wondering if he d die on the way but after all the open air cure was tried for his trouble in various other parts of the world why not here there was no doubt about it nicholas had a capital team of dogs and knew how to drive them two legged folk often had to trot pretty briskly to keep up pymeut was soon out of sight nicholas what ll you take for a couple o your dogs no sell pay you a good long price no sell well will you help me to get a couple me try but he spoke dubiously what do they cost good leader cost hunder and fifty in st michael you don t mean dollahs mean dollahs come off the roof but nicholas seemed to think there was no need you mean that if i offer you a hundred and fifty dollahs for your leader straight off this minute you won t take it no no take said the prince stolidly and his friend reflected nicholas without a dog team would be practically a prisoner for eight months of the year and not only that but a prisoner in danger of starving to death after all perhaps a dog team in such a country was priceless and the ol chief was travelling in truly royal style however it was stinging cold and running after those expensive dogs was an occupation that palled by and by \"how much is your sled worth \" he asked ol chief six sables said the monarch it was a comfort to sight a settlement off there on the point what s this place fish town pymeuts there no all gone come back when salmon run not a creature there as nicholas had foretold a place built wilfully on the most exposed point possible bleak beyond belief if you open your mouth at this place on the yukon you have to swallow a hurricane the boy choked turned his back to spit out the throttling blast and when he could catch his breath inquired this a good place for a village bully wind come blow muskeetah nicholas signified a remote destination with his whip b lieve you this kind o thing would discourage even a mosquito in the teeth of the blast they went past the pymeut summer resort unlike pymeut proper its cabins were built entirely above ground of logs unchinked its roofs of watertight birch bark a couple of hours farther on nicholas permitted a halt on the edge of a struggling little grove of dwarfed cotton wood the kettle and things being withdrawn from various portions of the ol chief s person he once more warmly tucked up and tightly lashed down drew the edge of the outer coverlid up till it met the wolf skin fringe of his parki hood and relapsed into slumber nicholas chopped down enough green wood to make a hearth what bang on the snow nicholas nodded laid the logs side by side and on them built a fire of the seasoned wood the boy had gathered they boiled the kettle made tea and cooked some fish ol chief waked up just in time to get his share the boy who had kept hanging about the dogs with unabated interest had got up from the fire to carry them the scraps when nicholas called out quite angrily \"no no feed dogs and waved the boy off what it s only some of my fish fish is what they eat ain t it \" no feed now wait till night what for they re hungry you give fish dogs no go any more peremptorily he waved the boy off and fell to work at packing up not understanding nicholas s wisdom the boy was feeling a little sulky and didn t help he finished up the fish himself then sat on his heels by the fire scorching his face while his back froze or wheeling round and singeing his new parki while his hands grew stiff in spite of seal skin mittens no it was no fun camping with the temperature at thirty degrees below zero better to be trotting after those expensive and dinnerless dogs and he was glad when they started again but once beyond the scant shelter of the cottonwood it was evident the wind had risen it was blowing straight out of the north and into their faces there were times when you could lean your whole weight against the blast after sunset the air began to fill with particles of frozen snow they did not seem to fall but continually to whirl about and present stinging points to the travellers faces talking wasn t possible even if you were in the humour and the dead blank silence of all nature unbroken hour after hour became as nerve wearing as the cold and stinging wind the boy fell behind a little those places on his heels that had been so badly galled had begun to be troublesome again well it wouldn t do any good to holla about it the only thing to do was to harden one s foolish feet but in his heart he felt that all the time honoured conditions of a penitential journey were being complied with except on the part of the arch sinner ol chief seemed to be getting on first rate the dogs hardly yet broken in to the winter s work were growing discouraged travelling so long in the eye of the wind and nicholas in the kind of stolid depression that had taken possession of him seemed to have forgotten even to shout \"mush \" for a very long time by and by ol chief called out sharply and nicholas seemed to wake up he stopped looked back and beckoned to his companion the boy came slowly on why you no push push what handle bar he went to the sled and illustrated laying his hands on the arrangement at the back that stood out like the handle behind a baby s perambulator the boy remembered of course there were usually two men with each sled one ran ahead and broke trail with snow shoes but that wasn t necessary today for the crust bore but the other man s business was to guide the sled from behind and keep it on the trail me gottah drive you gottah push dogs heap tired nicholas spoke severely the boy stared a moment at what he mentally called \"the nerve of the fella laughed and took hold swallowing nicholas s intimation that he after all was far more considerate of the dogs than the person merely sentimental who had been willing to share his dinner with them how much farther \" oh pretty quick now the driver cracked his whip called out to the dogs and suddenly turned off from the river course unerringly he followed an invisible trail turning sharply up a slough and went zig zagging on without apparent plan it was better going when they got to a frozen lake and the dogs seemed not to need so much encouragement it would appear an impossible task to steer accurately with so little light but once on the other side of the lake it was found that nicholas had hit a well beaten track as neatly as a thread finds the needle s eye far off out of the dimness came a sound welcome because it was something to break the silence but hardly cheerful in itself hear that nicholas mission dogs their own had already thrown up their noses and bettered the pace the barking of the dogs had not only announced the mission to the travellers but to the mission a stranger at the gates before anything could be seen of the settlement clumsy fur clad figures had come running down the slope and across the ice greeting nicholas with hilarity indian or esquimaux boys they seemed to be who talked some jargon understanded of the pymeut pilot the boy lifting tired eyes saw something white glimmering high in the air up on the right river bank in this light it refused to form part of any conceivable plan but hung there in the air detached enigmatic spectral below it more on humanity s level could be dimly distinguished now the mission buildings apparently in two groups with an open space in the middle where are the white people wondered the boy childishly impatient won t they come and welcome us he followed the esquimaux and indians from the river up to the left group of buildings with the heathen jargon beating on his ears he looked up suddenly and realized what the white thing was that had shone out so far in the middle of the open space a wooden cross stood up encrusted with frost crystals and lifting gleaming arms out of the gloom twenty feet or so above the heads of the people funny thing for an agnostic he admitted to himself \"but i m right glad to see a christian sign \" and as he knocked at the door of the big two story log house on the left he defended himself \"it s the swing back of the pendulum after a big dose of pymeut and heathen tricks i welcome it as a mark of the white man \" he looked over his shoulder a little defiantly at the holy cross recognition of what the high white apparition was had given him a queer jolt stirring unsuspected things in imagination and in memory he had been accustomed to see that symbol all his life and it had never spoken to him before up here it cried aloud and dominated the scene \"humph \" he said to himself \"to look at you a body d think the origin had never been written and spencer and huxley had never been born he knocked again and again turned about to scan the cross just as much a superstition just as much a fetich as kaviak s seal plug or the sham n s eagle feather with long looking at a couple of crossed sticks men grow as dazed as hypnotized as pymeuts watching a sham n s ivory wand all the same i m not sure that faith in first principles would build a house like this in the arctic regions and it s convenient to find it here if only they d open the door he gave another thundering knock and then nearly fell backwards into the snow for brother paul stood on the threshold holding up a lamp i a oh how do you do can i come in brother paul still with the look of the avenging angel on his pale young face held the door open to let the boy come in then leaning out into the night and lifting the lamp high \"is that nicholas \" he said sternly but the pymeuts and the school boys had vanished he came in and set down the lamp we a we heard you were going down river said the boy tamely for he had not yet recovered himself after such an unexpected blow are you cold are you wet demanded brother paul standing erect unwelcoming by the table that held the lamp the boy pulled himself together look here he turned away from the comforting stove and confronted the jesuit \"those pymeuts are not only cold and wet and sick too but they re sorry they ve come to ask forgiveness \" it s easily done such scorn you would hardly expect from a follower of the meek galilean no not easily done a penance like this i know for i ve just travelled that thirty miles with em over the ice from pymeut you yes it amuses you the sombre eyes shone with a cold disconcerting light well to tell you the truth i ve been better amused the boy looked down at his weary wounded feet and the others where were his fellow pilgrims it struck him as comic that the upshot of the journey should be that he was doing penance for the pymeuts but he couldn t smile with that offended archangel in front of him thirty miles over the ice in the face of a norther hasn t been so easy even for me and i m not old nor sick no nor frightened brother paul he flung up his head but his heart failed him even while he made the boast silently for a moment they confronted each other where are you bound for i a the boy had a moment of wondering if he was expected to answer hell and he hesitated are you on your way up the river no i was the man not going to let them rest their wicked bones there a single night \"a i \" the frozen river and the wind racked wood were as hospitable as the beautiful face of the brother involuntarily the boy shivered i came to see the father superior he dropped back into a chair the father superior is busy i ll wait and very tired so m i worn out with the long raging of the plague i have waited till he is less harassed to tell him about the pymeuts deliberate depravity nicholas too one of our own people one of the first pupils of the school a communicant in the church distinguished by a thousand kindnesses and this the return the return is that he takes his backsliding so to heart he can t rest without coming to confess and to beg the father superior i shall tell the father superior what i heard and saw he will agree that for the sake of others who are trying to resist temptation an example should be made of nicholas and of his father and yet you nursed the old man and were kind to him i believe after the offense i i thought you had killed him but even you must see that we cannot have a man received here as nicholas was the most favoured child of the mission who helps to perpetuate the degrading blasphemies of his unhappy race it s nothing to you you even encourage pon my soul but brother paul struck in with an impassioned earnestness we spend a life time making christians of these people and such as you come here and in a week undo the work of years i i it s only eighteen months since i myself came but already i ve seen the torrent poured out with never a pause \"last summer some white prospectors bribed our best native teacher to leave us and become a guide he s a drunken wreck now somewhere up on the yukon flats you take our boys for pilots you entice our girls away with trinkets \" great caesar i don t but vain was protest for brother paul the visitor was not a particular individual he stood there for the type of the vicious white adventurer the sunken eyes of the lay brother burning impersonal saw not a particular young man and a case compounded of mixed elements but the enemy against whom night and day he waged incessant warfare the fathers and sisters wear out their lives to save these people we teach them with incredible pains the fundamental rules of civilization we teach them how to save their souls alive the boy had jumped up and laid his hand on the door knob \" you come you teach them to smoke \" the boy wheeled round i don t smoke and to gamble nicholas taught me to gamble brother paul i swear yes and to swear and get drunk and so find the shortest way to hell father brachet father wills a voice called without the door knob turned under the boy s hand and before he could more than draw back a whiff of winter blew into the room and a creature stood there such as no man looks to find on his way to an arctic gold camp a girl of twenty odd with the face of a saint dressed in the black habit of the order of st anne oh brother paul you are wanted wanted quickly i think catherine is worse don t wait or she ll die without and as suddenly as she came the vision vanished carrying brother paul in the wake of her streaming veil the boy sat down by the stove cogitating how he should best set about finding nicholas to explain the failure of their mission what was that voices from the other side the opposite door opened and a man appeared with nicholas and his father close behind looking anything but cast down or decently penitential how do you do the white man s english had a strong french accent he shook hands with great cordiality \"we have heard of you from father wills also these pymeut friends of ours say you have something to tell me \" he spoke as though this something were expected to be highly gratifying and indeed the cheerfulness of nicholas and his father would indicate as much as the boy hesitating did not accept the chair offered smiling the jesuit went on will you talk of zis matter whatever it is first or will you first go up and wash and have our conference after supper no thank you a are you the father superior he bowed a little ceremoniously but still smiling i am father brachet oh well nicholas is right the first thing to do is to explain why we re here was it the heat of the stove after the long hours of cold that made him feel a little dizzy he put up his hand to his head i have told zem to take hot water upstairs the father was saying and i zink a glass of toddy would be a good sing for you he slightly emphasised the \"you and turned as if to supplement the original order no no \" the boy called after him choking a little half with suppressed merriment half with nervous fatigue \"father brachet if you re kind to us brother paul will never forgive you we re all in disgrace \" hein what yes we re all desperately wicked no no objected nicholas ready to go back on so tactless an advocate and brother paul has just been saying what is it what is it the father superior spoke a little sharply and himself sat down in the wooden armchair he before had placed for his white guest the three culprits stood in front of him on a dead level of iniquity you see father brachet ol chief has been very ill i know much as we needed him here paul insisted on hurrying back to pymeut he interrupted himself as readily as he had interrupted the boy \"but ze ol chief looks lively enough \" yes he a his spirits have been raised by a what you will think an unwarrantable and wicked means nicholas understood at least that objectionable word \"wicked\" cropping up again and he was not prepared to stand it from the boy he grunted with displeasure and said something low to his father brother paul found them found us having a s ance with the sham n father brachet turned sharply to the natives ha you go back to zat nicholas came a step forward twisting his mittens and rolling his eye excitedly us no wicked sham n say he gottah scare off he waved his arm against an invisible army then as it were stung into plain speaking sham n say white man bring sickness bring devils maybe the old orang outang s right the boy drew a tired breath and sat down without bidding in one of the wooden chairs what an idiot he d been not to take the hot grog and the hot bath and leave these people to fight their foolishness out among themselves it didn t concern him and here was nicholas talking away comfortably in his own tongue and the father was answering a native opened the door and peeped in cautiously nicholas paused hein said father brachet \"what is it \" the indian came in with two cups of hot tea and a cracker in each saucer he stopped at the priest s side you get sick too please take supper little late he nodded to nicholas and gave the white stranger the second cup as he was going out \"same man here in july you know\" he tapped himself on the left side \"man with sore heart \" yansey said the priest quickly \"well what about yansey \" he is here but no wiz zose ozzers no i think they took the dogs and deserted him he s just been brought in by our boys they are back with the moose meat sore heart worse he will die who s looking after him brother paul and he padded out of the room in his soft native shoes then brother paul has polished off catherine thought the boy \"and he won t waste much time over a sore heart it behoves us to hurry up with our penitence \" this seemed to be nicholas s view as well he was beginning again in his own tongue you know we like best for you to practise your english said the priest gently \"i expect you speak very well after working so long on ze john j healy \" yes nicholas straightened himself \"me talk all same white man now \" he gleamed at the boy \"don t suppose i need you and your perfidious tongue \" \"no us pymeuts no wicked \" again he turned away from the priest and challenged the boy to repeat the slander then with an insinuating air \"sham n no say you wicked he reassured the father sham n say holy cross all right cheechalko no good cheechalko bring devils cheechalko all same him he wound up flinging subterfuge to the winds and openly indicating his faithless ambassador strikes me i m gettin the worst of this argument all round brother paul s been sailing into me on pretty much the same tack \" no said nicholas firmly \"brother paul no unnerstan you unnerstan \" he came still nearer to the father speaking in a friendly confidential tone \"you savvy plague come on steamboat up from st michael one white man he got coast sickness sun shining salmon run big yukon full o boats two days no canoe on river men all sit in tent like so \" he let his mittens fall on the floor crouched on his heels and rocked his head in his hands springing up he went on with slow sorrowful emphasis \"men begin die \" zen we come said the father \"wiz nurses and proper medicine \" nicholas gave the ghost of a shrug adding the damaging fact \"sickness come to holy cross \" the father nodded we ve had to turn ze schools into wards for our patients he explained to the stranger \"we do little now but nurse ze sick and prepare ze dying ze muzzer superieure has broken down after heroic labours paul i fear is sickening too yes it s true ze disease came to us from pymeut \" in the father s mind was the thought of contagion courageously faced in order to succour \"the least of these my brethren \" in nicholas s mind was the perplexing fact that these white men could bring sickness but not stay it even the heap good people at holy cross were not saved by their deaf and impotent god fathers sick eight sisters sick boy die in school three girl die holy cross people kind again he made that almost french motion of the shoulders \"sham n say peeluck no good be kind to devils scare em make em run \" nicholas the priest spoke wearily \"i am ashamed of you i sought you had learned better zat old sham n he is a rare old rogue what did you give him \" nicholas mental processes may not have been flattering but their clearness was unmistakable if father brachet was jealous of the rival holy man s revenue it was time to bring out the presents ol chief had a fine lynx skin over his arm he advanced at a word from nicholas and laid it down before the father no said father brachet with startling suddenness \"take it away and try to understand \" nicholas approached trembling but no doubt remembering how necessary it had been to add to the sham n s offering before he would consent to listen with favour to pymeut prayers he pulled out of their respective hiding places about his person a carved ivory spoon and an embroidered bird skin pouch advanced boldly under the fire of the superior s keen eyes and sharp words and laid the further offering on the lynx skin at his feet take zem away said the priest interrupting his brief homily and standing up \"don t you understand yet zat we are your friends wizzout money and wizzout price we do not want zese sings sham n takes ivories from ze poor furs from ze shivering and food from zem zat starve and he gives nossing in return nossing take zese sings away no one wants zem at holy cross \" ol chief wiped his eyes pathetically nicholas the picture of despair turned in a speechless appeal to his despised ambassador before anyone could speak the door knob rattled rudely and the big bullet head of a white man was put in pardon mon p re cet homme qui vient de min ok faudrait le coucher de suite mais o mon dieu o while the superior cogitated \"how do brother etienne \" said nicholas and they nodded brother etienne brought the rest of his heavy body half inside the door he wore aged weather beaten breeches and a black sweater over an old hickory shirt ses compagnons l ont laiss l je crois mais a ne durera pas longtemps faudra bien qu il reste ici je ne vois pas d autre moyen said the father \"enfin on verra attendez quelques instants \" c est bien brother etienne went out ol chief was pulling the boy s sleeve during the little colloquy and saying \"you tell \" but the boy got up like one who means to make an end you haven t any time or strength for this oh yes said father brachet smiling and arresting the impetuous movement \"ziz is part of it \" well said the boy still hesitating \"they are sorry you know really sorry \" you sink so the question rang a little sceptically yes i do and i m in a position to know you d forgive them if you d seen as i did how miserable and overwhelmed they were when brother paul when i m not saying it s the highest kind of religion that they re so almighty afraid of losing your good opinion but it it gives you a hold doesn t it and then as the superior said nothing only kept intent eyes on the young face the boy wound up a little angrily \"unless of course you re like brother paul ready to throw away the power you ve gained \" paul serves a great and noble purpose but zese questions are a not in his province still he bored into the young face with those kind gimlets his good little eyes and you are one of us he asked \"of ze church \" no i i m afraid i m not of any church ah and i ought to take back afraid but i m telling you the truth when i say there never were honester penitents than the pymeuts the whole kachime s miserable even the girl ol chief s daughter she cried like anything when she thought sister winifred sister winifred would be disappointed in her ah yes sister winifred has zem he held out his hand spread the fingers apart and slowly gently closed them \"comme a \" but what s the good of it if brother paul ah it is not just zere paul comes in but i tell you my son paul does a work here no ozzer man has done so well he is a flint a fanatic fanatique he flung out an expressive hand \"it is a name my son it often means no more but zat a man is in earnest out of such a flint we strike sparks and many a generous fire is set alight we all do what we can here at holy cross but paul will do what we cannot \" well give me he was on the point of saying \"father wills but changed it to a man who is tolerant \" tolerant zere are plenty to be tolerant my son ze world is full but when you find a man zat can care zat can be fanatique ah it is he came a little nearer \"it is but as if i would look at you and say he has earnest eyes he will go far whatever road he follow \" he drew off smiling shrewdly \"you may live my son to be yourself called fanatique zen you will know how little \" i the boy broke in \"you are pretty wide of the mark this time \" ah perhaps but zere are more trails zan ze yukon for a fanatique you have zere somesing to show me i promised the girl that cried so i promised her to bring the sister this he had pulled out the picture in spite of the careful wrapping it had got rather crumpled the father looked at it and then a swift glance passed between him and the boy you could see it was like pulling out teeth to part with it can it go up there till the sister sends for it father brachet nodded and the gorgeous worldling counselling all men to \"smoke kentucky leaf \" was set up in the high place of honour on the mantel shelf beside a print of the madonna and the holy child nicholas cheered up at this and ol chief stopped wiping his eyes while the boy stood at the mantel with his back to father brachet acting on a sudden impulse he pulled the ivory pen rest out of his shirt and stuck its various parts together saying as he did so \"she sent an offering to you too if the ol chief an i fail to convince you of our penitence we re all willin to let this gentleman plead for us \" whereupon he wheeled round and held up the woeful one before the father s eyes the priest grasped the offering with an almost convulsive joy and instantly turned his back that the pymeuts might not see the laugh that twisted up his humorous old features the penitents looked at each other and telegraphed in pymeut that after all the boy had come up to time the father had refused the valuable lynx skin and nicholas superior spoon but was ready it appeared to look with favour on anything the boy offered but very seriously the priest turned round upon the pymeuts \"i will just say a word to you before we wash and go in to supper \" with a kindly gravity he pronounced a few simple sentences about the gentleness of christ with the ignorant but how offended the heavenly father was when those who knew the true god descended to idolatrous practices and how entirely he could be depended upon to punish wicked people ol chief nodded vigorously and with sudden excitement \"me jus like god \" hein oh yes me no stan wicked people when me young me kill two ol squaws witches with an outward gesture of his lean claws he swept these wicked ones off the face of the earth like a besom of the lord a sudden change had passed over the tired face of the priest \"go go \" he called out driving the pymeuts forth as one shoos chickens out of a garden \"go to ze schoolhouse and get fed for it s all you seem able to get zere \" but the perplexed flight of the pymeuts was arrested brother paul and brother etienne blocked the way with a stretcher they all stood back to let the little procession come in nobody noticed them further but the pymeuts scuttled away the instant they could get by the boy equally forgotten sat down in a corner while the three priests conferred in low voiced french over the prostrate figure father brachet a weak voice came up from the floor brother paul hurried out calling brother etienne softly from the door i am here the superior came from the foot of the pallet and knelt down near the head you remember what you said last july about about making restitution yes well i can do it now i am glad i ve brought you the papers that s why i had to come will you take them out of my the priest unbuckled a travel stained buckskin miner s belt and laid it on the floor all the many pockets were empty save the long one in the middle he unbuttoned the flap and took out some soiled worn looking papers \"are zese in proper form \" he asked but the man seemed to have dropped into unconsciousness hurriedly the priest added \"zere is no time to read zem ah mr will you come and witness zis last will and testament \" the boy got up and stood near the man from min ok opened his eyes here the priest had got writing materials and put a pen into the slack hand with a block of letter paper under it i i m no lawyer said the faint voice \"but i think it s all in shape anyhow you write and i ll sign \" he half closed his eyes and the paper slipped from under his hand the boy caught it and set down the faint words \"will and bequeath to john m berg kansas city my right and title to claim no above little min ok yukon ramparts \" and the voice fell away into silence they waited a moment and the superior whispered can you sign it the dull eyes opened \"didn t i \" father brachet held him up the boy gave him the pen and steadied the paper \"thank you father obliged to you too \" he turned his dimming eyes upon the boy who wrote his name in witness \"you going to min ok \" i hope so the father went to the writing table where he tied up and sealed the packet anybody that s going to min ok will have to hustle the slang of everyday energy sounded strangely from dying lips almost a whisper and yet like a far off bugle calling a captive to battle the boy leaned down to catch the words yet fainter good claims going like hot cakes how much the boy asked breathless \"did you get out of yours \" waiting till summer nex summer the eyelids fell so it isn t a fake after all the boy stood up \"the camp s all right \" you ll see it will out boom the klondyke ha how long have you been making the trip since august the wild flame of enterprise sunk in the heart of the hearer since august no cash for steamers we had a canoe she went to pieces up by the weak voice fell down into that deep gulf that yawns waiting for man s last word but there is gold at min ok you re sure you ve seen it the father superior locked away the packet and stood up but the boy was bending down fascinated listening at the white lips \"there is gold there \" he repeated out of the gulf came faintly back like an echo plenty o gold there plenty o gold jee rusalem he stood up and found himself opposite the contemplative face of the priest we have neglected you my son come upstairs to my room they went out the old head bent and full of thought the young head high and full of dreams oh to reach this min ok where there was plenty of gold plenty of gold before the spring floods brought thousands what did any risk matter think of the pymeuts doing their sixty miles over the ice just to apologise to father brachet for being pymeuts this other this white man s penance might would involve a greater mortification of the flesh what then the reward was proportionate \"plenty of gold \" the faint whisper filled the air a little more hardship and the long process of fortune building is shortened to a few months no more office grind no more anxiety for those one loves gold plenty of gold while one is young and can spend it gaily gold to buy back the orange grove to buy freedom and power to buy wings and to buy happiness on the stairs they passed brother paul and the native supper in five minutes father the superior nodded there is a great deal to do the native went on hurriedly to paul we ve got to bury catherine to morrow and this man from min ok agreed paul pausing with his hand on the door chapter vii kaviak s crime \"my little son who look d from thoughtful eyes and moved and spoke in quiet grown up wise having my law the seventh time disobey d i struck him and dismiss d with hard words and unkiss d \" even with the plague and brother paul raging at the mission even with everyone preoccupied by the claims of dead and dying the boy would have been glad to prolong his stay had it not been for \"nagging\" thoughts of the colonel as it was with the mercury rapidly rising and the wind fallen he got the pymeuts on the trail next day at noon spent what was left of the night at the kachime and set off for camp early the following day he arrived something of a wreck and with an enormous respect for the yukon trail it did him good to sight the big chimney and still more to see the big colonel putting on his snow shoes near the bottom of the hill where the cabin trail met the river trail when the boss o the camp looked up and saw the prodigal coming along rather groggy on his legs he just stood still a moment then he kicked off his web feet turned back a few paces uphill and sat down on a spruce stump folded his arms and waited was it the knapsack on his back that bowed him so hello kentucky but the colonel didn t look up till the boy got quite near chanting in his tuneless voice \" grasshoppah sett n on a swee p tater vine swee p tater vine swee p tater vine \" what s the matter hey colonel sorry as all that to see me back reckon it s the kind o sorrah i can bear said the colonel \"we thought you were dead \" you ought t known me better were you just sendin out a rescue party of one the colonel nodded \"that party would have started before but i cut my foot with the axe the day you left where have you been in the name o the nation \" pymeut an holy cross holy cross holy moses you yes and do you know one thing i saw there gave me a serious nervous shock that don t surprise me what was it sheets when i came to go to bed a real bed colonel on legs i found i was expected to sleep between sheets and i just about fainted that the only shock you had no i had several i saw an angel i tell you straight colonel you can bank on what i m sayin that jesuit outfit s all right oh you think so the rejoinder came a little sharply yes sir i just do i think i d be bigoted not to admit it so you ll be thick as peas in a pod with the priests now well i m the one that can afford to be they won t convert me and from my point o view it don t matter what a man is s long s he s a decent fella the colonel s only answer was to plunge obliquely uphill say boss wait for me the colonel looked back the boy was holding on to a scrub willow that put up wiry twigs above the snow feel as if i d never get up the last rungs o this darn ice ladder tired h m something of a walk to holy cross even on a nice mild day like this the colonel made the reflection with obvious satisfaction took off his knapsack and sat down again the boy did the same \"the very day you lit out father orloff came up from the russian mission \" what s he like oh little fella in petticoats with a beard an a high pot hat like a russian and that same afternoon we had a half breed trader fella here with two white men since that day we haven t seen a human creature we bought some furs of the trader where d you get yours pymeut any news about the strike well the trader fella was sure it was all gammon and told us stories of men who d sacrificed everything and joined a stampede and got sold sold badly but the two crazy whites with him miners from dakotah they were on fire about min ok kept on bragging they hadn t cold feet and swore they d get near to the diggins as their dogs d take em the half breed said they might do a hundred miles more but probably wouldn t get beyond anvik crazy fools i tell you to travel even thirty miles on the yukon in winter even with a bully team and old nick to drive em and not an extra ounce on your back i tell you colonel it s no joke b lieve you sonny it wasn t thirty seconds before sonny was adding \"did that half breed think it was any use our trying to get dogs \" ain t to be had now for love or money lord colonel if we had a team yes i know we ll probably owe our lives to the fact that we haven t it suddenly occurred to the boy that although he had just done a pretty good tramp and felt he d rather die than go fifty feet further it was the colonel who was most tired how s everybody oh i s pose we might all of us be worse off what s the matter he was so long answering that the boy s eyes turned to follow the serious outward gaze of the older man even before he lifted one hand and swept it down the hill and out across the dim grey prospect this said the colonel their eyes had dropped down that last stretch of the steep snow slope across the two miles of frozen river and ran half round the wide horizon line like creatures in a cage whether they liked it or whether they didn t for them there was no way out it s the awful stillness the colonel arraigned the distant ice plains they sat there looking listening as if they hoped their protest might bring some signal of relenting no creature not even a crystal coated willow twig nothing on all the ice bound earth stirred by as much as a hair no mark of man past or present broke the grey monotony no sound but their two voices disturbed the stillness of the world it was a quiet that penetrated that pricked to vague alarm already both knew the sting of it well it s the kind of thing that gets on a fella s nerves said the colonel \"i don t know as i ever felt helpless in any part of the world before but a man counts for precious little up here do you notice how you come to listen to the silence \" oh yes i ve noticed stop again he lifted his hand and they strained their ears \"i ve done that by the hour since you left and the daft gold diggers went up trail after you the other fellas feel it too don t know what we d have done without kaviak think we ought to keep that kid you know \" i could get on without kaviak if only we had some light it s this villainous twilight that gets into my head all the same you know he stood up suddenly \"we came expecting to stand a lot didn t we \" the elder man nodded \"big game big stakes it s all right \" eventless enough after this except for the passing of an indian or two the days crawled by the boy would get up first in the morning rake out the dead ashes put on a couple of back logs bank them with ashes and then build the fire in front he broke the ice in the water bucket and washed filled coffee pot and mush kettle with water or ice and swung them over the fire then he mixed the corn bread put it in the dutch oven covered it with coals and left it to get on with its baking sometimes this part of the programme was varied by his mixing a hoe cake on a board and setting it up \"to do\" in front of the fire then he would call the colonel \" wake up massa de day am breakin peas in de pot en de hoe cake bakin \" for it was the colonel s affair to take up proceedings at this point make the coffee and the mush and keep it from burning fry the bacon and serve up breakfast saturday brought a slight variation in the early morning routine the others came straggling in as usual but once a week mac was sure to be first for he had to get kaviak up mac s view of his whole duty to man seemed to centre in the saturday scrubbing of kaviak vainly had the esquimer stood out against compliance with this most repulsive of foreign customs he seemed to be always ready with some deep laid scheme for turning the edge of mac s iron resolution he tried hiding at the bottom of the bed it didn t work the next time he crouched far back under the lower bunk he was dragged out another saturday he embedded himself like a moth in a bundle of old clothes mac shook him out he had been very sanguine the day he hid in the library this was a wooden box nailed to the wall on the right of the door most of the bigger books byron wordsworth dana s \"mineralogy and two bibles he had taken out and concealed in the lower bunk very skilfully far back behind the colonel s feet copps s mining\" and the two works on \"parliamentary law\" piled at the end of the box served as a pillow after climbing in and folding himself up into an incredibly small space kaviak managed with superhuman skill to cover himself neatly with a patchwork quilt of munsey scribner century strand and overland for august no one would suspect glancing into that library that underneath the usual top layer of light reading was matter less august than law poetry science and revelation it was the base byron tipping the wink to mac out of the back of the bunk that betrayed kaviak it became evident that \"farva\" began to take a dour pride in the kid s perseverance one morning he even pointed out to the camp the strong likeness between kaviak and robert bruce no sah the scottish chief had to have an object lesson but kaviak lawd kaviak could give points to any spider livin this was on the morning that the esquimer thought to escape scrubbing even at the peril of his life by getting up on to the swing shelf how no man ever knew but there he sat in terror like a very young monkey in a wind rocked tree hardly daring to breathe his arms clasped tight round the demijohn but having mac to deal with the end of it was that he always got washed and equally always he seemed to register a vow that s help him heaven it should never happen again after breakfast came the clearing up it should have been done under this r gime by the little cabin men but it seldom was o flynn was expected to keep the well hole in the river chopped open and to bring up water every day this didn t always happen either though to drink snow water was to invite scurvy father wills said there was also a daily need if the colonel could be believed for everybody to chop firewood we got enough was potts invariable opinion for how long s pose we get scurvy and can t work we d freeze to death in a fortnight never saw a fireplace swalla logs whole an never blink like this one but you got no objection to sittin by while the log swallerin goes on the colonel or the boy cooked the eternal beans bacon and mush dinner after whatever desultory work was done as a matter of fact there was extraordinarily little to occupy five able bodied men the fun of snow shoeing mitigated by frostbite quickly degenerated from a sport into a mere means of locomotion one or two of the party went hunting now and then for the scarce squirrel and the shy ptarmigan they tried with signal lack of success to catch fish indian fashion through a hole in the ice but for the most part as winter darkened round them they lounged from morning till night about the big fireplace and smoked and growled and played cards and lived as men do finding out a deal about each other s characters something about each other s opinions and little or nothing about each other s history in the appalling stillness of the long arctic night any passer by was hailed with enthusiasm and although the food supply in the big cabin was plainly going to run short before spring no traveller white indian or esquimaux was allowed to go by without being warmed and fed and made to tell where he came from and whither he was bound questions to tax the sage their unfailing hospitality was not in the least unexpected or unusual being a virtue practised even by scoundrels in the great north west but it strained the resources of the little camp a fourth of whose outfit lay under the yukon ice in the state of lowered vitality to which the poor ill cooked food the cold and lack of exercise was slowly reducing them they talked to one another less and less as time went on and more and more silently and each against his will grew hyper sensitive to the shortcomings and even to the innocent \"ways\" of the other fellow not mac s inertia alone but his trick of sticking out his jaw became an offence his rasping voice a torture the boy s occasional ebullition of spirits was an outrage the colonel s mere size intolerable o flynn s brogue which had amused them grew to be just part of the hardship and barbarism that had overtaken them like an evil dream coercing subduing all the forces of life only kaviak seemed likely to come unscathed through the ordeal of the winter s captivity only he could take the best place at the fire the best morsel at dinner and not stir angry passions only he dared rouse mac when the nova scotian fell into one of his bear with a sore head moods kaviak put a stop to his staring angrily by the hour into the fire and set him to whittling out boats and a top thereby providing occupation for the morrow since it was one man s work to break kaviak of spinning the one on the table during mealtime and sailing the other in the drinking water bucket at all times when older eyes weren t watching the colonel wrote up his journal and read the midsummer magazines and byron in the face of mac s \"i do not like byron s thought i do not consider him healthy or instructive \" in one of his more energetic moods the colonel made a four footed cricket for kaviak who preferred it to the high stool and always sat on it except at meals once in a while when for hours no word had been spoken except some broken reference to a royal flush or a jack pot or o flynn had said bedad i ll go it alone or potts had inquired anxiously \"got the joker guess i m euchred then the boy in desperation would catch up kaviak balance the child on his head or execute some other gymnastic soothing the solemn little heathen s ruffled feelings afterwards by crooning out a monotonous plantation song it was that kind of addition to the general gloom that at first would fire o flynn to raise his own spirits at least by roaring out an irish ditty but this was seldomer as time went on even jimmie s brogue suffered and grew less robust in a depressed sort of way mac was openly teaching kaviak his letters and surreptitiously down in the little cabin his prayers he was very angry when potts and o flynn eavesdropped and roared at kaviak s struggles with ow farva \" in fact kaviak did not shine as a student of civilisation though that told less against him with o flynn than the fact that he wasn t \"jolly and jump about like white children \" moreover jimmie swore there was something \"bogey\" about the boy s intermittent knowledge of english often for days he would utter nothing but \"farva\" or \"maw\" when he wanted his plate replenished then suddenly he would say something that nobody could remember having taught him or even said in his presence it was not to be denied that kaviak loved sugar mightily and stole it when he could mac lectured him and slapped his minute yellow hands and kaviak stole it all the same when he was bad that is when he had eaten his daily fill of the camp s scanty store in such a little place it was not easy to hide from such a hunter as kaviak he was taken down to the little cabin smacked and made to say \"ow farva \" nobody could discover that he minded much though he learnt to try to shorten the ceremony by saying \"i solly\" all the way to the cabin as a rule he was strangely undemonstrative but in his own grave little fashion he conducted life with no small intelligence and learned with an almost uncanny quickness each man s uses from the kaviak point of view the only person he wasn t sworn friends with was the handy man and there came to be a legend current in the camp that kaviak s first attempt at spontaneously stringing a sentence under that roof was \"me got no use for potts \" the best thing about kaviak was that his was no craven soul he was obliged to steal the sugar because he lived with white people who were bigger than he and who always took it away when they caught him but once the sugar was safe under his shirt he owned up without the smallest hesitation and took his smacking like a man for the rest he flourished filled out and got as fat as a seal but never a whit less solemn one morning the colonel announced that now the days had grown so short and the trio were so late coming to breakfast and nobody did any work to speak of it would be a good plan to have only two meals a day the motion was excessively unpopular but it was carried by a plain and somewhat alarming exposition of the state of supplies we oughtn t to need as much food when we lazy round the fire all day said the colonel but potts retorted that they d need a lot more if they went on adoptin the aborigines they knocked off supper and all but the aborigine knew what it meant sometimes to go hungry to bed towards the end of dinner one day late in december when everybody else had finished except for coffee and pipe the aborigine held up his empty plate haven t you had enough asked the colonel mildly surprised at kaviak s bottomless capacity maw still the plate was extended there isn t a drop of syrup left said potts who had drained the can and even wiped it out carefully with halves of hot biscuit he don t really want it mustn t open a fresh can till to morrow no sir ee we ve only got besides he ll bust kaviak meanwhile during this paltry discussion had stood up on the high stool \"farva\" had made for him and personally inspected the big mush pot then he turned to mac and pointing a finger like a straw nothing could fatten those infinitesimal hands he said gravely and fluently maw in de plenty bowl yes maw mush but no maw syrup the round eyes travelled to the store corner we ll have to open a fresh can some time what s the odds mac got up and not only kaviak watched him for syrup was a luxury not expected every day every neck had craned every pair of eyes had followed anxiously to that row of rapidly diminishing tins all that was left of the things they all liked best and they still this side of christmas what you rubber neckin about mac snapped at the boy as he came back with the fresh supply this unprovoked attack was ample evidence that mac was uneasy under the eyes of the camp angry at his own weakness and therefore the readier to dare anybody to find fault with him how can i help watchin you said the boy mac lifted his eyes fiercely \"i m fascinated by your winnin ways we re all like that \" kaviak had meanwhile made a prosperous voyage to the plenty bowl and returned to mac s side an absurd little figure in a strange priest like cassock buttoned from top to bottom a waistcoat of mac s and a jacket of the boy s which was usually falling off and trailed on the ground when it wasn t and whose sleeves were rolled up in inconvenient muffs still with a gravity that did not seem impaired by these details he stood clutching his plate anxiously with both hands while down upon the corn mush descended a slender golden thread manipulated with a fine skill to make the most of its sweetness it curled and spiralled and described the kind of involved and long looped flourishes which the grave and reverend of a hundred years ago wrote jauntily underneath the most sober names lovingly the dark eyes watched the engrossing process even when the attenuated thread was broken and the golden rain descended in slow infrequent drops kaviak stood waiting always for just one drop more that s enough greedy now go away and gobble but kaviak daintily skimmed off the syrupy top and left his mush almost as high a hill as before it wasn t long after the dinner things had been washed up and the colonel settled down to the magazines he was reading the advertisements now that potts drew out his watch golly do you fellers know what o clock it is he held the open timepiece up to mac \"hardly middle o the afternoon all these hours before bedtime and nothin to eat till to morrow \" why you ve just finished but look at the time the colonel said nothing maybe he had been a little previous with dinner today it was such a relief to get it out of the way oppressive as the silence was the sound of potts s voice was worse and as he kept on about how many hours it would be till breakfast the colonel said to the boy johnny get your gun and we ll go out in these december days before the watery sun had set the great rich coloured moon arose having now in her resplendent fulness quite the air of snuffing out the sun the pale and heavy eyed day was put to shame by this brilliant night lamp that could cast such heavy shadows and by which men might read the instant the big cabin door was opened kaviak darted out between the colonel s legs threw up his head like a siwash dog sniffed at the frosty air and the big orange moon flung up his heels and tore down to the forbidden the fascinating fish hole if he hadn t got snared in his trailing coat he would have won that race when the two hunters had captured kaviak and shut him indoors they acted on his implied suggestion that the fish trap ought to be examined they chopped away the fresh formed ice empty as usual it had been very nice and neighbourly of nicholas as long ago as the st of december to bring the big new cornucopia shaped trap down on his sled on the way to the ikogimeut festival it had taken a long time to cut through the thick ice to drive in the poles and fasten the slight fencing in such relation to the mouth of the sunken trap that all well conducted fish ought easily to find their way thither as a matter of fact they didn t potts said it was because the boy was always hauling out the trap \"to see\" but what good would it be to have it full of fish and not know they had been out about an hour when the colonel brought down a ptarmigan and said he was ready to go home the boy hesitated going to give in and cook that bird for supper it was a tempting proposition but the colonel said rather sharply no sir got to keep him for a christmas turkey well i ll just see if i can make it a brace the colonel went home hung his trophy outside to freeze and found the trio had decamped to the little cabin he glanced up anxiously to see if the demijohn was on the shelf yes and kaviak sound asleep in the bottom bunk the colonel would climb up and have forty winks in the top one before the boy got in for their game of chess he didn t know how long he had slept when a faint scratching pricked through the veil of slumber and he said to himself \"kaviak s on a raid again but he was too sodden with sleep to investigate just before he dropped off again however opening a heavy eye he saw potts go by the bunk stop at the door and listen then he passed the bunk again and the faint noise recommenced the colonel dropped back into the gulf of sleep never even woke for his chess and in the morning the incident had passed out of his mind just before dinner the next day the boy called out see here who s spilt the syrup \" spilt it syrup no it don t seem to be spilt either he patted the ground with his hand you don t mean that new can not a drop in it he turned it upside down every eye went to kaviak he was sitting on his cricket by the fire waiting for dinner he returned the accusing looks of the company with self possession come here he got up and trotted over to \"farva \" have you been to the syrup kaviak shook his head you must have been no you sure he nodded how did it go all away do you know again the silent denial kaviak looked over his shoulder at the dinner preparations and then went back to his cricket it was the best place from which to keep a strict eye on the cook the gintlemin don t feel conversaytional wid a pint o surrup in his inside i tell you he d be currled up with colic if he well said o flynn hopefully \"bide a bit he ain t lookin very brash \" come here kaviak got up a second time but with less alacrity have you got a pain he stared does it hurt you there kaviak doubled up suddenly he s awful ticklish said the boy mac frowned with perplexity and kaviak retired to the cricket does the can leak anywhere that excuse won t hold water cause the can will the colonel had just applied the test besides it would have leaked on to something mac agreed oh well let s mosy along with our dinner said potts it s gettin pretty serious remarked the colonel \"we can t afford to lose a pint o syrup \" no siree we can t but there s one thing about kaviak said the boy \"he always owns up look here kiddie don t say no don t shake your head till you ve thought now think hard \" kaviak s air of profound meditation seemed to fill every requirement did you take the awful good syrup and eat it up kaviak was in the middle of a head shake when he stopped abruptly the boy had said he wasn t to do that nobody had seemed pleased when he said \"no \" i b lieve we re on the right track he s remembering think again you are a tip top man at finding sugar aren t you yes fin shugh kaviak modestly admitted his prowess in that direction and you get hungry in the early morning yes he would go so far as to admit that he did you go skylarkin about and you remember the syrup can and you get hold of it didn t you to malla you mean yesterday this morning n sh kaviak blinked wait and think yesterday this was full you remember mac opened it for you kaviak nodded and now you see he turned the can bottom side up \"all gone \" oh h murmured kaviak with an accent of polite regret then with recovered cheerfulness he pointed to the store corner \"maw \" potts laughed in his irritating way and mac s face got red things began to look black for kaviak say fellas see here the boy hammered the lid on the can with his fist and then held it out \"it was put away shut up for i shut it and even one of us can t get that lid off without a knife or something to pry it \" the company looked at the small hands doubtfully they were none too little for many a forbidden feat how had he got on the swing shelf how ye see crayther it must uv been yersilf becuz there isn t annybuddy else look here said the colonel \"we ll forgive you this time if you ll own up just tell us \" kaviak again that journey from the cricket to the judgment seat show us mac had taken the shut tin and now held it out \"show us how you got the lid off \" but kaviak turned away mac seized him by the shoulder and jerked him round everyone felt it to be suspicious that kaviak was unwilling even to try to open the all too attractive can was he really cunning and did he want not to give himself away wasn t he said to be much older than he looked and didn t he sometimes look a hundred and wise for his years see here i haven t caught you in a lie yet but if i do kaviak stared drew a long breath and seemed to retire within himself you d better attend to me for i mean business kaviak recalled from internal communing studied \"farva\" a moment and then retreated to the cricket as to a haven now hastily and with misgiving tripping over his trailing coat mac stood up wait old man the colonel stooped his big body till he was on a level with the staring round eyes \"yo see child yo can t have any dinnah till we find out who took the syrup \" the little yellow face was very serious he turned and looked at the still smoking plenty bowl are yoh hungry he nodded got up briskly held up his train and dragged his high stool to the table scrambled up and established himself look at that said the colonel triumphantly \"that youngster hasn t just eaten a pint o syrup \" mac was coming slowly up behind kaviak with a face that nobody liked looking at oh let the brat alone and let s get to our grub said potts with an extreme nervous irritation mac swept kaviak off the stool \"you come with me \" only one person spoke after that till the meal was nearly done that one had said \"yes farva and followed mac dinnerless out to the little cabin the colonel set aside a plateful for each of the two absent ones and cleared away the things potts stirred the fire in a shower of sparks picked up a book and flung it down searched through the sewing kit for something that wasn t lost and then went to the door to look at the weather so he said o flynn sat dozing by the fire he was in the way of the washing up stir your stumps jimmie said the colonel and get us a bucket of water \" sleepily o flynn gave it as his opinion that he d be damned if he did with unheard of alacrity \"i ll go said potts the colonel stared at him and by some trick of the brain he had a vision of potts listening at the door the night before and then resuming that clinking scratching sound in the corner the store corner hand me over my parki will you \" potts said to the boy he pulled it over his head picked up the bucket and went out seems kind o restless don t he yes colonel hey nothin ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by funny mac don t come for his dinner isn t it s pose i go and look em up s pose you do not far from the door he met mac coming in well said the boy meaning where s the kid well mac echoed defiantly \"i lammed him as i d have lammed robert bruce if he d lied to me \" the boy stared at this sudden incursion into history but all he said was \"your dinner s waitin \" the minute mac got inside he looked round hungrily for the child not seeing him he went over and scrutinised the tumbled contents of the bunks where s kaviak p raps you ll tell us you mean he isn t here mac wheeled round sharply here he didn t come back here for his dinner haven t seen him since you took him out mac made for the door the boy followed kaviak each called in turn it was quite light enough to see if he were anywhere about although the watery sun had sunk full half an hour before the fantastically huge full moon hung like a copper shield on a steel blue wall do you see anything whispered mac no who s that yonder potts gettin water the boy was bending down looking for tracks mac looked too but ineffectually feverishly isn t potts calling i knew he would if he saw us he s never carried a bucket uphill yet without help see there are the kid s tracks going we must find some turned the other way they were near the little cabin now here shouted the boy \"and yes here again \" and so it was clean and neatly printed in the last light snowfall showed the little footprints \"we re on the right trail now kaviak \" through his parki the boy felt a hand close vise like on his shoulder and a voice not like maccann s goin straight down to the fish trap hole the two dashed forward down the steep hill the boy saying breathless as they went \"and potts where s potts \" he had vanished but there was no time to consider how or where kaviak kaviak and as they got to the river think i hear so do i coming coming hold on tight coming kaviak they made straight for the big open fish hole farther away from the little cabin and nearer the bank was the small well hole between the two they noticed as they raced by the water bucket hung on that heavy piece of driftwood that had frozen aslant in the river mac saw that the bucket rope was taut and that it ran along the ice and disappeared behind the big funnel of the fish trap the sound was unmistakable now a faint choked voice calling out of the hole \"help \" coming hold tight half a minute and how it was done or who did it nobody quite knew but potts still clinging by one hand to the bucket rope was hauled out and laid on the ice before it was discovered that he had kaviak under his arm kaviak stark and unconscious with the round eyes rolled back till one saw the whites and nothing more mac picked the body up and held it head downwards laid it flat again and stripping off the great sodden jacket already beginning to freeze fell to putting kaviak through the action of artificial breathing we must get them up to the cabin first thing said the boy but mac seemed not to hear don t you see kaviak s face is freezing still mac paid no heed potts lifted a stiff uncertain hand and with a groan let it fall heavily on his own cheek come on i ll help you in anyhow potts can t walk in this damned wet fur with some difficulty having dragged off potts soaked parki already stiffening unmanageably the boy tried to get him on his feet once you re in the cabin you re all right but the benumbed and miserable potts kept his eyes on kaviak as if hypnotised by the strange new death look in the little face well i can t carry you up said the boy and after a second he began to rub potts furiously glancing over now and then to see if kaviak was coming to while mac dumb and tense laboured on without success potts under the boy s ministering showed himself restored enough to swear feebly h ray my man s comin round how s yours no answer but he could see that the sweat poured off mac s face as he worked unceasingly over the child the boy pulled potts into a sitting posture it was then that mac without looking up said run and get whiskey run like hell when he got back with the colonel and the whiskey o flynn floundering in the distance potts was feebly striking his breast with his arms and mac still bent above the motionless little body they tried to get some of the spirit down the child s throat but the tight clenched teeth seemed to let little or nothing pass the stuff ran down towards his ears and into his neck but mac persisted and went on pouring drop by drop whenever he stopped trying to restore the action of the lungs o flynn just barely managed to get \"a swig\" for potts in the interval though they all began to feel that mac was working to bring back something that had gone for ever the boy went and bent his face down close over the rigid mouth to feel for the breath when he got up he turned away sharply and stood looking through tears into the fish hole saying to himself \"yukon inua has taken him \" he was in too long potts teeth were chattering and he looked unspeakably wretched \"when my arm got numb i couldn t keep his head up \" and he swallowed more whiskey \"you fellers oughtn t to have left that damn trap up \" what s that got to do with it said the boy guiltily kaviak knew it ought to be catchin fish when i came down he was cryin and pullin the trap backwards towards the hole then he slipped come mac said the colonel quietly \"let s carry the little man to the cabin \" no no not yet stuffy heat isn t what he wants and he worked on they got potts up on his feet i called out to you fellers didn t you hear me y yes but we didn t understand well you d better have come it s too late now o flynn half dragged half carried him up to the cabin for he seemed unable to walk in his frozen trousers the colonel and the boy by a common impulse went a little way in the opposite direction across the ice what can we do colonel nothing it s not a bit o use they turned to go back well the duckin will be good for potts parki anyhow said the boy in an angry and unsteady voice what do you mean when he asked me to hand it to him i nearly stuck fast to it it s all over syrup and we don t wear furs at our meals tchah the colonel stopped with a face of loathing yes he was the only one of us that didn t bully the kid to day couldn t go that far but couldn t own up potts is a cur yes sah then after an instant s reflection \"but he s a cur that can risk his life to save a kid he don t care a damn for \" they went back to mac and found him pretty well worn out the colonel took his place but was soon pushed away mac understood better he said had once brought a chap round that everybody said was dead he wasn t dead the great thing was not to give in a few minutes after kaviak s eyelids fluttered and came down over the upturned eyeballs mac with a cry that brought a lump to the colonel s throat gathered the child up in his arms and ran with him up the hill to the cabin three hours later when they were all sitting round the fire kaviak dosed and warm and asleep in the lower bunk the door opened and in walked a white man followed by an indian i m george benham they had all heard of the anvik trader a man of some wealth and influence and they made him welcome the indian was his guide he said and he had a team outside of seven dogs he was going to the steamship oklahoma on some business and promised father wills of holy cross that he d stop on the way and deliver a letter to mr maccann stop on the way i should think so we were goin to have supper to night anyhow and you ll stay and sleep here all mac s old suspicions of the jesuits seemed to return with the advent of that letter i ll read it presently he laid it on the mantel shelf between the sewing kit and the tobacco can and he looked at it angrily every now and then while he helped to skin mr benham that gentleman had thrown back his hood pulled off his great moose skin gauntlets and his beaver lined cap and now with a little help dragged the drill parki over his head and after that the fine lynx bordered deer skin standing revealed at last as a well built fellow of thirty eight or so in a suit of mackinaws standing six feet two in his heelless salmon skin snow boots \"bring in my traps will you \" he said to the indian and then relapsed into silence the indian reappeared with his arms full fine lot o pelts you have there said the colonel benham didn t answer he seemed to be a close mouthed kind of a chap as the indian sorted and piled the stuff in the corner potts said got any furs you want to sell no where you takin em down to the oklahoma all this stuff for cap n rainey benham nodded i reckon there s a mistake about the name and he s cap n tom thumb or commodore nutt the boy had picked up a little parki made carefully of some very soft dark fur and trimmed with white rabbit the small hood bordered with white fox that s a neat piece of work said the colonel benham nodded \"one of the shageluk squaws can do that sort of thing \" what s the fur musk rat and they talked of the weather how the mercury last week had been solid in the trading post thermometer so it was \"over forty degrees anyhow \" what s the market price of a coat like that mac said suddenly that isn t a market coat it s for a kid of rainey s back in the states still mac eyed it enviously what part of the world are you from sir said the colonel when they had drawn up to the supper table san francisco used to teach numskulls latin and mathematics in the las palmas high school what s the value of a coat like that little one interrupted mac oh about twenty dollars the shageluks ask that much benham laughed \"if you asked the shageluks they d say forty \" you ve been some time in this part of the world i understand said the colonel twelve years without going home been home twice only stayed a month couldn t stand it i ll give you twenty two dollars for that coat said mac i ve only got that one and as i think i said i ll give you twenty four it s an order you see rainey i ll give you twenty six benham shook his head sorry yes it s queer about the hold this country gets on you the first year is hell the second is purgatory with glimpses of something else the third well more and more forever after you realise the north s taken away any taste you ever had for civilisation that s when you ve got the hang of things up here when you ve learned not to stay in your cabin all the time and how to take care of yourself on the trail but as for going back to the boredom of cities no thank you mac couldn t keep his eyes off the little coat finally to enable him to forget it as it seemed he got up and opened father wills letter devoured its contents in silence and flung it down on the table the colonel took it up and read aloud the father s thanks for all the white camp s kindness to kaviak and now that the sickness was about gone from holy cross how the fathers felt that they must relieve their neighbours of further trouble with the little native i ve said i d take him back with me when i come up river about christmas we d be kind o lost now without the little beggar said the boy glancing sideways at mac there s nothin to be got by luggin him off to holy cross answered that gentleman severely unless it s clo es said potts he s all right in the clo es he s got said mac with the air of one who closes an argument he stood up worn and tired and looked at his watch you ain t goin to bed this early said potts quite lively and recovered from his cold bath that was the worst of sleeping in the little cabin bedtime broke the circle you left interesting visitors behind and sometimes the talk was better as the night wore on well someone ought to wood up down yonder o flynn will you go o flynn was in the act of declining the honour but benham who had been saying \"it takes a year in the yukon for a man to get on to himself interrupted his favourite theme to ask your other cabin like this \" whereon o flynn shameless of the contrast in cabins jumped up and said \"come and see while i wood up \" you re very well fixed here said benham rising and looking round with condescension \"but men like you oughtn t to try to live without real bread no one can live and work on baking powder \" there was a general movement to the door of which benham was the centre i tell you a lump of sour dough kept over to raise the next batch is worth more in this country than a pocket full of gold i ll give you twenty eight for that musk rat coat said mac benham turned stared back at him a moment and then laughed oh well i suppose i can get another made for rainey before the first boat goes down then is it on account o the bread the colonel was saying \"that the old timer calls himself a sour dough \" all on account o the bread they crowded out after benham coming the boy who was last held the door open mac shook his head it wasn t one of the bitter nights they d get down yonder and talk by the fire till he went in and disturbed them that was all he had wanted for mac was the only one who had noticed that kaviak had waked up he was lying as still as a mouse alone with him at last mac kept his eyes religiously turned away sat down by the fire and watched the sparks by and by a head was put up over the board of the lower bunk mac saw it but sat quite still farva he meant to answer the appeal half cleared his throat but his voice felt rusty it wouldn t turn out a word kaviak climbed timidly shakily out and stood in the middle of the floor in his bare feet farva he came a little nearer till the small feet sank into the rough brown curls of the buffalo the child stooped to pick up his wooden cricket wavered and was about to fall mac shot out a hand steadied him an instant without looking and then set the cricket in front of the fire he thereupon averted his face and sat as before with folded arms he hadn t deliberately meant to make kaviak be the first to \"show his hand\" after all that had happened but something had taken hold of him and made him behave as he hadn t dreamed of behaving it was perhaps a fear of playing the fool as much as a determination to see how much ground he d lost with the youngster the child was observing him with an almost feverish intensity with eyes fixed upon the wooden face to find out how far he might venture shakily he dragged the cricket from where mac placed it closer closer and as no terrible change in the unmoved face warned him to desist he pulled it into its usual evening position between mac s right foot and the fireplace he sank down with a sigh of relief as one who finishes a journey long and perilous the fire crackled and the sparks flew gaily kaviak sat there in the red glow dressed only in a shirt staring with incredulous mournful eyes at the farva who had then as mac made no sign he sighed again and held out two little shaky hands to the blaze mac gave out a sound between a cough and a snort and wiped his eyes on the back of his hand kaviak had started nervously you cold asked mac kaviak nodded hungry he nodded again and fell to coughing mac got up and brought the newly purchased coat to the fire it s for you he said as the child s big eyes grew bigger with admiration me me own coat he stood up and his bare feet fluttered up and down feebly but with huge delight as the parki was held ready the child tumbled dizzily into it and mac held him fast an instant in less than five minutes kaviak was once more seated on the cricket but very magnificent now in his musk rat coat so close up to mac that he could lean against his arm and eating out of a plenty bowl on his knees a discreet spoonful of mush drowned in golden syrup a supper for a sultan if only there had been more when he had finished he set the bowl down and as a puppy might he pushed at mac s arm till he found a way in laid his head down on farva s knee with a contented sigh and closed his heavy eyes mac put his hand on the cropped head and began about that empty syrup can kaviak started up shaking from head to foot was the obscure nightmare coming down to crush him again mac tried to soothe him but kaviak casting about for charms to disarm the awful fury of the white man able to endure with dignity any reverse save that of having his syrup spilt cried out i solly solly our farva i m sorry too kaviak mac interrupted gathering the child up to him \"and we won t either of us do it any more \" chapter viii christmas \"himlen morkner mens jordens trakt straaler lys som i stjernedragt himlen er bleven jordens gjaest snart er det julens sode fest \" it had been moved seconded and carried by acclamation that they should celebrate christmas not so much by a feast of reason as by a flow of soul and a bang up dinner to be followed by speeches and some sort of cheerful entertainment we re goin to lay ourselves out on this entertainment said the boy with painful misgivings as to the \"bang up dinner \" every time the banquet was mentioned somebody was sure to say \"well anyhow there s potts s cake and that reflection never failed to raise the tone of expectation for potts s cake was a beauty evidently very rich and fruity and fitted by nature to play the noble part of plum pudding but in making out the bill of fare facts had to be faced we ve got our everyday little rations of beans and bacon and we ve got potts s cake and we ve got one skinny ptarmigan to make a banquet for six hungry people \" but we ll have a high old time and if the bill o fare is a little restricted there s nothin to prevent our programme of toasts songs and miscellaneous contributions from bein rich and varied and one thing we can get even up here the colonel was looking at kaviak \"and that s a little christmas tree \" y yes said potts \"you can get a little tree but you can t get the smallest kind of a little thing to hang on it \" sh said the boy \"it must be a surprise \" and he took steps that it should be for he began stealing away kaviak s few cherished possessions his amulet his top from under the bunk his boats from out the water bucket wherewith to mitigate the barrenness of the yukon tree and to provide a pleasant surprise for the esquimer who mourned his playthings as gone for ever of an evening now after sleep had settled on kaviak s watchful eyes the boy worked at a pair of little snow shoes helped out by a ball of sinew he had got from nicholas mac bethought him of the valuable combination of zoological and biblical instruction that might be conveyed by means of a noah s ark he sat up late the last nights before the th whittling chipping pegging in legs sharpening beaks and inking eyes that the more important animals might be ready for the deluge by christmas the colonel made the ark and o flynn took up a collection to defray the expense of the little new mucklucks he had ordered from nicholas they were to come \" sure by christmas eve and o flynn was in what he called a froightful fanteeg\" as the short day of the th wore towards night and never a sign of the one eyed pymeut half a dozen times o flynn had gone beyond the stockade to find out if he wasn t in sight and finally came back looking intensely disgusted bringing a couple of white travellers who had arrived from the opposite direction very cold one of them deaf and with frost bitten feet and both so tired they could hardly speak of course they were made as comfortable as was possible the frozen one rubbed with snow and bandaged and both given bacon and corn bread and hot tea you oughtn t to let yourself get into a state like this said mac thinking ruefully of these strangers obvious inability to travel for a day or two and of the christmas dinner to which benham alone had been bidden by a great stretch of hospitality that s all very well said the stranger who shouted when he talked at all \"but how s a man to know his feet are going to freeze \" ye see sorr o flynn explained absent mindedly \"misther maccann didn t know yer pardner was deaf \" this point of view seemed to thaw some of the frost out of the two wayfarers they confided that they were salmon p hardy and bill schiff fellow passengers in the merwin \"locked in the ice down below and they d mined side by side back in the states at cripple creek yes sir and sailed for the klondyke from seattle last july \" and now at christmas they were hoping that with luck they might reach the new min ok diggings seven hundred miles this side of the klondyke before the spring rush during this recital o flynn kept rolling his eyes absently theyse a quare noise without it s the wind knockin down yer chimbly says mr hardy encouragingly it don t sound like nich las annyhow may the divil burrn him in tarment and ile fur disappoyntin th kid a rattle at the latch and the pymeut opened the door lorrd love ye ye re a jool nich las screamed o flynn and the mucklucks passed from one to the other so surreptitiously that for all kaviak s wide eyed watchfulness he detected nothing nicholas supped with his white friends and seemed bent on passing the night with them he had to be bribed with tobacco and a new half dollar to go home and keep christmas in the bosom of his family and still at the door he hesitated drew back and laid the silver coin on the table no it nights but it isn t really dark pretty soon heap dark why i thought you natives could find your way day or night yes find way then what s the matter pymeut no like dark and it was not until mac put on his own snow shoes and offered to go part of the way with him that nicholas was at last induced to return home the moment kaviak was ascertained to be asleep o flynn displayed the mucklucks no mistake they were dandies the boy hung one of them up by its long leg near the child s head at the side of the bunk and then conferred with o flynn the colonel s made some little kind o sweet cake things for the tree i could spare you one or two divil a doubt kaviak ll take it kindly but furr mesilf i m thinkin a pitaty s a dale tastier there was just one left in camp it had rolled behind the flour sack and o flynn had seized on it with rapture where everybody was in such need of vegetable food nobody under estimated the magnificence of o flynn s offering as he pushed the pitaty down into the toe of the muckluck sure the little haythen ll have a foine christian christmas wid that same to roast in the coals begorra and they all went to bed save mac who had not returned and the boy who put on his furs and went up the hill to the place where he kept the christmas tree lodged in a cotton wood he shook the snow off its branches brought it down to the cabin decorated it and carried it back mac salmon p hardy and the frost bitten schiff were waked bright and early christmas morning by the boy s screaming with laughter the colonel looked down over the bunk s side and the men on the buffalo skin looked up and they all saw kaviak sitting in bed holding in one hand an empty muckluck by the toe and in the other a half eaten raw potato keep the rest of it to roast anyhow or o flynn s heart will be broken so they deprived kaviak of the gnawed fragment and consoled him by helping him to put on his new boots when the little cabin contingent came in to breakfast \"hello what you got up on the roof \" says potts foot of earth and three feet o snow but what s in the bundle bundle echoes the boy if you put a bundle on the roof i s pose you know what s in it says the colonel severely the occupants of the two cabins eyed each other with good humoured suspicion thank you says the boy \"but we re not takin any bundles to day \" call next door advised the colonel you think we re tryin to jolly you but just go out and see for yourself no sir you ve waked the wrong passenger they re tryin it on us said potts and subsided into his place at the breakfast table during the later morning while the colonel wrestled with the dinner problem the boy went through the thick falling snow to see if the tree was all right and the dogs had not appropriated the presents half way up to the cotton wood he glanced back to make sure kaviak wasn t following and there sure enough just as the little cabin men had said there below him on the broad eaved roof was a bundle packed round and nearly covered over with snow he went back eyeing it suspiciously whatever it was it seemed to be done up in sacking for a bit stuck out at the corner where the wind struck keen the boy walked round the cabin looking listening nobody had followed him or nothing would have induced him to risk the derision of the camp as it was he would climb up very softly and lightly and nobody but himself would be the wiser even if it was a josh he brushed away the snow touching the thing with a mittened hand and a creepy feeling at his spine it was precious heavy and hard as iron he tugged at the sacking \"jee if i don t b lieve it s meat \" the lid of an old cardboard box was bound round the frozen mass with a string and on the cardboard was written moose and christmas greeting from kaviak s friends at holy cross to kaviak s friends by the big chimney h ray h ray come out you fellas hip hip hurrah and the boy danced a breakdown on the roof till the others had come out and then he hurled the moose meat down over the stockade and sent the placard flying after they all gathered round mac and read it be the siven well i swan don t forget boy you re not takin any just remember if it hadn t been for me it might have stayed up there till spring you run in kaviak or you ll have no ears but that gentleman pulled up his hood and stood his ground how did it get on the roof in the name o the nation asked the colonel stamping his feet never hear of santa claus didn t i tell you kaviak he drove his reindeer team over the roofs did you hear any dogs go by in the night i didn t nicholas brought it i s pose and was told to cache it up there maybe that s why he came late to give us a surprise don t believe it we d have heard him somebody from the mission came by in the night and didn t want to wake us and saw there were dogs it s froze too hard to cut interrupted salmon p hardy who had been trying his jack knife on one end \"it s too big to go in any mortal pot \" and it ll take a month to thaw they tried chopping it but you could more easily chop a bolt of linen sheeting the axe laboriously chewed out little bits and scattered shreds stop we ll lose a lot that way while they were lamenting this fact and wondering what to do the dogs set up a racket and were answered by some others benham was coming along at a rattling pace his dogs very angry to find other dogs there putting on airs of possession we got all this moose meat says potts when benham arrived on the scene \"but we can t cut it \" of course not where s your hand saw the boy brought it and mr benham triumphantly sawed off two fine large steaks kaviak scraped up the meat saw dust and ate it with grave satisfaction with a huge steak in each hand the colonel beaming led the procession back to the cabin the boy and mac cached the rest of the moose on the roof and followed fine team that one o yours said salmon p hardy to the trader you ll get to min ok anyhow not me hey i m not going that way mean to skip the country got cold feet no i m satisfied enough with the country said the trader quietly and acknowledged the introduction to mr schiff sitting in bandages by the fire benham turned back and called out something to his guide i thought maybe you d like some oysters for your christmas dinner he said to the colonel when he came in again \"so i got a couple o cans from the a c man down below \" and a mighty whoop went up the great rapture of that moment did not however prevent o flynn s saying under his breath did ye be chanct now think of bringin a dtrop o hey no says benham a little shortly huh ye say that like s if ye wuz a taytotlerr not me but i find it no good to drink whiskey on the trail ah says salmon p with interest \"you prefer brandy \" no says benham \"i prefer tea \" lorrd now look at that drink spirit and it s all very fine and reviving for a few minutes but a man can t work on it it s the wan thing sorr says o flynn with solemnity \"it s the wan thing on the top o god s futstool that makes me feel i cud wurruk \" not in this climate and you re safe to take cold in the reaction cowld is ut faith ye ll be tellin us mr schiff got his toes froze wid settin too clost be the foire you don t seriously mean you go on the trail without any alcohol asks the colonel no i don t go without but i keep it on the outside of me unless i have an accident salmon p studied the trader with curiosity a man with seven magnificent dogs and a native servant and the finest furs he d ever seen here was either a capitalist from the outside or a man who had struck it rich \"on the inside \" been in long crossed the chilcoot in june what twelve year ago benham nodded gosh then you ve been in the klondyke not since the gold was found and got a team like that n outside and not even goin to min ok guess not what made the feller so damn satisfied only one explanation was possible he d found a mine without going even as far as min ok he was a man to keep your eye on a goodly aroma of steaming oysters and of grilling moose arose in the air the boy set up the amended bill of fare lit the christmas candles one at the top one at the bottom of the board and the colonel announced the first course though it wasn t one o clock and they usually dined at four the soup was too absorbingly delicious to admit of conversation the moose steaks had vanished like the \"snaw wreath in the thaw\" before anything much was said save nothin th matter with moose hey nop bet your life the \"salmi of ptarmigan\" appeared as a great wash of gravy in which portions of the much cut up bird swam in vain for their lives but the high flat rim of the dish was plentifully garnished by fingers of corn bread and the gravy was \"galoppshus so potts said salmon p having appeased the pangs of hunger returned to his perplexed study of benham did i understand you to say you came into this country to prospect \" came down the never know what and prospected a whole summer at forty mile what river did you come by same as you go by the yukon indians up yonder call it the never know what and the more you find out about it the better you think the name did you do any good at forty mile not enough to turn my head so i tried the koyukuk and other diggins too hear that schiff he roared at his bandaged friend \"never say die this gen l man s been at it twelve years tried more n one camp but now well he s so well fixed he don t care a cuss about the klondyke \" schiff lit up and pulled hard at the cutty o flynn had taken kaviak to the fire and was showing him how to roast half a petaty in wood ashes but he was listening to the story and putting in \"be the siven \" at appropriate moments schiff poured out a cloud of rank smoke gen lemen he said \"the best klondyke claims ll be potted min ok s the camp o the future you d better come along with us \" got no dogs sighed the boy but the two strangers looked hard at the man who hadn t that excuse benham sat and idly watched preparations for the next course say a nabob like you might give us a tip how did you do the trick well i d been playing your game for three years and no galley slave ever worked half as hard that s it work like the devil for a couple o years and then live like a lord for ever after yes well when the time came for me to go into the lord business i had just forty two dollars and sixty cents to set up on what had you done with the rest i d spent the five thousand dollars my father left me and i d cleaned up just forty two dollars sixty cents in my three years mining the announcement fell chill on the company i was dead broke and i had no credit i went home but mac roused himself \"you didn t stay \" no you don t stay as a rule mac remembered caribou \"get used to this kind o thing and miss it miss it so you \" you came back says salmon p impatient of generalities and won this time whispered schiff for that is how every story must end the popular taste in fiction is universal a friend at home grub staked me and i came in again came down on the high water in june prospected as long as my stuff lasted and then well i didn t care about starving i became an a c trader a long pause this was no climax everybody waited and now i m on my own i often make more money in a day trading with the indians in furs fish and cord wood than i made in my whole experience as a prospector and miner a frost had fallen on the genial company but even if you hadn t any luck the boy suggested \"you must have seen others \" oh i saw some washing gravel that kept body and soul together and i saw some that didn t in the pause he added remorseless i helped to bury some of them your experience was unusual or why do men come back year after year did you ever hear of a thing called hope they moved uneasily on their stools and some rubbed stubbly chins with perplexed uncertain fingers and they all glowered at the speaker he was uncomfortable this fellow well there mayn t be as much gold up here as men think but there s more hope than anywhere on earth to hell with hope give me certainty says salmon p exactly so you shuffle the cards and laugh down the five cent limit you ll play one last big game and it ll be for life this time as well as fortune cheerful cuss ain t he whispered schiff they say we re a nation of gamblers well sir the biggest game we play is the game that goes on near the arctic circle what s the matter with wall street tisn t such a pretty game and they don t play for their lives i tell you it s love of gambling brings men here and it s the splendid stiff game they find going on that keeps them there s nothing like it on earth his belated enthusiasm deceived nobody it don t seem to have excited you much said mac oh i ve had my turn at it and just by luck i found i could play another a safer game and not bad fun either he sat up straight and shot his hands down deep in the pockets of his mackinaws \"i ve got a good thing and i m willing to stay with it \" the company looked at him coldly well drawled potts \"you can look after the fur trade give me a modest little claim in the klondyke \" oh klondyke klondyke benham got up and stepped over kaviak on his way to the fire he lit a short briarwood with a flaming stick and turned about \"shall i tell you fellows a little secret about the klondyke \" he held up the burning brand in the dim room with telling emphasis the smoke and flame blew black and orange across his face as he said every dollar that s taken out of the klondyke in gold dust will cost three dollars in coin a sense of distinct dislike to benham had spread through the company a fellow who called american enterprise love of gambling for whom heroism was foolhardy and hope insane where was a pioneer so bold he could get up now and toast the klondyke who now without grim misgiving could forecast a rosy future for each man at the board and that in brief had been the programme oh help the puddin colonel said the boy like one who starts up from an evil dream but they sat chilled and moody eating plum pudding as if it had been so much beans and bacon mac felt robert bruce s expensive education slipping out of reach potts saw his girl tired of waiting taking up with another fellow the boy s orange grove was farther off than florida schiff and hardy wondered for a moment who was the gainer for all their killing hardship not they at present although there was the prospect the hope oh damn the trader the colonel made the punch o flynn drained his cup without waiting for the mockery of that first toast to our enterprise although no one had taken more interest in the programme than o flynn benham talked about the anvik saw mill and the money made in wood camps along the river nobody listened though everyone else sat silent smoking and sulkily drinking his punch kaviak s demand for some of the beverage reminded the boy of the christmas tree it had been intended as a climax to wind up the entertainment but to produce it now might save the situation he got up and pulled on his parki back n a minute but he was gone a long time benham looked down the toast list and smiled inwardly for it was klondyked from top to bottom the others too stole uneasy glances at that programme staring them in the face unabashed covertly ironic nay openly jeering they actually hadn t noticed the fact before but every blessed speech was aimed straight at the wonderful gold camp across the line not the klondyke of benham s croaking but the klondyke of their dreams even the death s head at the feast regretted the long postponement of so spirited a programme interspersed as it promised to be with songs dances and \"tricks and winding up with an original poem he won t be happy till he gets it \" benham s indian had got up and gone out kaviak had tried to go too but the door was slammed in his face he stood there with his nose to the crack exactly as a dog does suddenly he ran back to mac and tugged at his arm even the dull white men could hear an ominous snarling among the mahlemeuts out of the distance a faint answering howl of derision from some enemy advancing or at bay it was often like this when two teams put up at the big chimney camp reckon our dogs are gettin into trouble said salmon p anxiously to his deaf and crippled partner it s nothing says the trader \"a siwash dog of any spirit is always trailing his coat\" and salmon p subsided not so kaviak back to the door head up he listened they had observed the oddity before the melancholy note of the mahlemeut never yet had failed to stir his sombre little soul he was standing now looking up at the latch high and made for white men eager breathing fast listening to that dismal sound that is like nothing else in nature listening as might an exiled scot to the skirl of bagpipes listening as a tyrolese who hears yodelling on foreign hills or as the dweller in a distant land to the sound of the dear home speech the noise outside grew louder the air was rent with howls of rage and defiance sounds as if there s bout a million mad dogs on your front stoop says schiff knowing there must be a great deal going on if any of it reached his ears you set still his pardner pushed him down on his stool \"mr benham and i ll see what s up \" the trader leisurely opened the door salmon p keeping modestly behind while kaviak darted forward only to be caught back by mac an avalanche of sound swept in a mighty howling and snarling and cracking of whips and underneath the higher clamour human voices and in dashes the boy powdered with snow laughing and balancing carefully in his mittened hands a little yukon spruce every needle diamond pointed every sturdy branch white with frost crystals and soft woolly snow and bearing its little harvest of curious fruit sweet cake rings and stars and two gingerbread men hanging by pack thread from the white and green branches the noah s ark lodged in one crotch the very amateur snow shoes in another and the lost toys wrapped up transfigured in tobacco foil dangling merrily before kaviak s incredulous eyes there s your christmas tree and the bringer who had carried the tree so that no little puff of snow or delicate crystal should fall off having made a successful entrance and dazzled the child gave way to the strong excitement that shot light out of his eyes and brought scarlet into his cheeks \"here take it \" he dashed the tree down in front of kaviak and a sudden storm agitated its sturdy branches it snowed about the floor and the strange fruit whirled and spun in the blast kaviak clutched it far too dazed to do more than stare the boy stamped the snow off his mucklucks on the threshold and dashed his cap against the lintel calling out come in come in let the dogs fight it out behind him between the snow walls at the entrance had appeared two faces weather beaten men crowding in the narrow space craning to see the reception of the christmas tree and the inside of the famous big chimney cabin these gentlemen says the boy shaking with excitement as he ushered them in \"are mr john dillon and general lighter they ve just done the six hundred and twenty five miles from min ok with dogs over the ice they ve been forty days on the trail and they re as fit as fiddles an no yonder for little min ok has made big millionaires o both o them \" millionaires or not they ll never either of them create a greater sensation than they did that christmas day in the big chimney cabin on the bleak hillside up above the never know what here was certainty at last here was justification precious symbols of success they were taken by both hands they were shaken and wildly welcomed \"peeled set down by the fire given punch asked ten thousand questions all in a breath rejoiced over and looked up to as glorious dispellers of doubt blessed saviours from despair schiff had tottered forward on bandaged feet hand round ear mouth open as if to swallow whole whatever he couldn t hear the colonel kept on bowing magnificently at intervals and pressing refreshment o flynn slapping his thigh and reiterating be the siven \" potts not only widened his mouth from ear to ear but as o flynn said after stretched it clane round his head and tyed it up furr jy in a nate knot behind benham took a back seat and when anybody remembered him for the next hour it was openly to gloat over his discomfiture john dillon was one of those frontiersmen rightly called typically american you see him again and again as a cowboy in texas as a miner or herdsman all through the far west you see him cutting lumber along the columbia or throwing the diamond hitch as he goes from camp to camp for gold and freedom he takes risks cheerfully and he never works for wages when he can go \"on his own \" john dillon was like the majority tall lean muscular not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his bones a face almost gaunt in its clearness of cut a thin straight nose chin not heavy but well curved out the eye orbit arched and deep a frown fixed between thick eyebrows and few words in his firm rather grim looking mouth he was perhaps thirty six had been \"in\" ten years and had mined before that in idaho under his striped parki he was dressed in spotted deer skin wore white deer skin mucklucks arctic cap and moose mittens pinned on his inner shirt was the badge of the yukon order of pioneers a footrule bent like the letter a above a scroll of leaves and in the angle two linked o s over y p it was the other man the western towns are full of general lighters who did the talking an attorney from seattle he had come up in the july rush with very little but boundless assurance fell in with an old miner who had been grubstaked by captain rainey out of the oklahoma s supplies and got to min ok before the river went to sleep no we re not pardners exactly he said glancing good humouredly at dillon \"we ve worked separate but we re going home two by two like animals into the ark we ve got this in common we ve both struck ile haven t we dillon \" dillon nodded little min ok s as rich a camp as dawson and the gold s of higher grade isn t it dillon that s right one of the many great advantages of min ok is that it s the nearest place on the river where they ve struck pay dirt says the general and another great advantage is that it s on the american side of the line what advantage is that mac grated out just the advantage of not having all your hard earnings taken away by an iniquitous tax look out this fella s a britisher don t care if he is and no disrespect to you sir the canadians in the klondyke are the first to say the tax is nothing short of highway robbery you ll see the minute they hear of gold across the line there ll be a stampede out of dawson i can put you in the way of getting a claim for eight thousand dollars that you can take eighty thousand out of next august with no inspector coming round to check your clean up and no government grabbing at your royalties why aren t you taking out that eighty thousand yourself asked mac bluntly got more n one man can handle answered the general \"reckon we ve earned a holiday \" dillon backed him up then it isn t shortage in provisions that takes you outside said the boy not much plenty of food at rampart city that s the name o the town where the little min ok meets the yukon food at gold craze prices i suppose no just about the same they quote you in seattle how is that possible when it s been carried four thousand miles because the a c and n a t and t boats got frozen in this side of dawson they know by the time they get there in june a lot of stuff will have come in by the short route through the lakes and the town will be overstocked so there s flour and bacon to burn when you get up as far as min ok it s only along the lower river there s any real scarcity the big chimney men exchanged significant looks and there are more supply boats wintering up at fort yukon and at circle city the general went on \"i tell you on the upper river there s food to burn \" again the big chimney men looked at one another the general kept helping himself to punch and as he tossed it off he would say min ok s the camp for me when he had given vent to this conviction three times benham who hadn t spoken since their entrance said quietly and you re going away from it as hard as you can pelt the general turned moist eyes upon him are you a man of family sir no then i cannot expect you to understand his eyes brimmed at some thought too fine and moving for public utterance each member of the camp sat deeply cogitating not only gold at min ok but food in the inner vision of every eye was a ship load of provisions \"frozen in\" hard by a placer claim in every heart a fervid prayer for a dog team the boy jumped up and ran his fingers through his long wild hair he panted softly like a hound straining at a leash then with an obvious effort to throw off the magic of min ok he turned suddenly about and poor old kaviak says he looking round and speaking in quite an everyday sort of voice the child was leaning against the door clasping the forgotten christmas tree so tight against the musk rat coat that the branches hid his face from time to time with reverent finger he touched silver boat and red foil top and watched fascinated how they swung a white child in a tenth of the time would have eaten the cakes torn off the transfiguring tinfoil tired of the tree and forgotten it the boy felt some compunction at the sight of kaviak s steadfast fidelity look here we ll set the tree up where you can see it better he put an empty bucket on the table and with mac s help wedged the spruce in it firmly between some blocks of wood and books of the law the cabin was very crowded little mr schiff was sitting on the cricket kaviak retired to his old seat on elephas beyond the bunks where he still had a good view of the wonderful tree agreeably lit by what was left of the two candles those things are good to eat you know said the colonel kindly mac cut down a gingerbread man and gave it into the tiny hands what wind blew that thing into your cabin asked the general squinting up his snow blinded eyes at the dim corner where kaviak sat there wasn t a man in the camp who didn t resent the millionaire s tone this is a great friend of ours ain t you kaviak said the boy he s got a soul above gold mines haven t you he sees other fellas helping themselves to his cricket and his high chair too polite to object just goes and sits like a philosopher on the bones of dead devils and looks on other fellas sittin in his place talkin about gold and drinkin punch never offerin him a drop several cups were held out but mac motioned them back i don t think says john dillon slyly \"don t think this punch will hurt the gentleman \" and a roar went up at the colonel s expense general lighter pulled himself to his feet saying there was a little good old rye left outside and he could stock up again when he got to the oklahoma oh and it s yersilf that don t shoy off from a dthrop o the craythur whin yer thravellin the thrail everybody looked at benham he got up and began to put on his furs his dog driver squatting by the door took the hint and went out to see after the team oh well said the general to o flynn \"it s christmas you know\" and he picked his way among the closely packed company to the door we ought to be movin too said dillon straightening up the general halted depressed at the reminder \"you know we swore we wouldn t stop again unless \" look here didn t you hear me saying it was christmas you been sayin that for twenty four hours been keepin christmas right straight along since yesterday mornin but the general had gone out to unpack the whisky \"he knocked up the mission folks bright and early yesterday to tell em about the glad news tiding s diggin s i mean \" what did they say weren t as good an audience as the general s used to that s why we pushed on we d heard about your camp and the general felt a call to preach the gospel accordin to min ok down this way he don t seem to be standin the racket as well as you said schiff well sir this is the first time i ve found him wantin to hang round after he s thoroughly rubbed in the news dillon moved away from the fire the crowded cabin was getting hot nevertheless the colonel put on more wood explaining to salmon p and the others who also moved back that it was for illuminating purposes those two candles burning down low each between three nails in a little slab of wood those two had been kept for christmas and were the last they had in the general movement from the fire benham putting on his cap and gloves had got next to dillon look here said the trader under cover of the talk about candles what sort of a trip have you had the yukon pioneer looked at him a moment and then took his pipe out of his mouth to say rank no fun hey that s right he restored the pipe and drew gently and yet to hear the general chirp he s got plenty o grit the general has has he got gold dillon nodded \"or will have \" out of min ok out of min ok in a sort of a kind of a way i think i understand benham wagged his head \"he s talkin for a market \" dillon smoked goin out to stir up a boom and sell his claim to some sucker the general reappeared with the whisky stamping the snow off his feet before he joined the group at the table where the christmas tree was seasonably cheek by jowl with the punch bowl between the low burnt candles mixing the new brew did not interrupt the general s ecstatic references to min ok look here he shouted across to mac \"i ll give you a lay on my best claim for two thousand down and a small royalty \" mac stuck out his jaw i d like to take a look at the country before i deal well see here when will you go we got no dogs we have exclaimed salmon p and scruff with one voice well i can offer you fellows how many miles did you travel a day sixty said the general promptly oh lord ejaculated benham and hurriedly he made his good byes what s the matter with you demanded the general with dignity i m only surprised to hear min ok s twenty four hundred miles away more like six hundred says the colonel and you ve been forty days coming and you cover sixty miles a day good bye he laughed and was gone well a the general looked round travelin depends on the weather dillon helped him out exactly depends on the weather echoed the general \"you don t get an old sour dough like dillon to travel at forty degrees \" how are you to know whispered schiff tie a little bottle o quick to your sled answered dillon bottle o what asked the boy quicksilver mercury interpreted the general no dog puncher who knows what he s about travels when his quick goes dead if the stuff s like lead in your bottle the general stopped to sample the new brew in the pause from the far side of the cabin dillon spat straight and clean into the heart of the coals well what do you do when the mercury freezes asked the boy camp said dillon impassively resuming his pipe i suppose the boy went on wistfully \"i suppose you met men all the way making straight for min ok \" only on this last lap they don t get far most of em but but it s worth trying the boy hurried to bridge the chasm the general lifted his right arm in the attitude of the orator about to make a telling hit but he was hampered by having a mug at his lips in the pause as he stood commanding attention at the same time that he swallowed half a pint of liquor he gave dillon time leisurely to get up knock the ashes out of his pipe stick it in his belt put a slow hand behind him towards his pistol pocket and bring out his buckskin gold sack now only mac of the other men had ever seen a miner s purse before but every one of the four cheechalkos knew instinctively what it was that dillon held so carelessly in that long narrow bag like the leg of a child s stocking was the stuff they had all come seeking the general smacked his lips and set down the granite cup that s the argument he said \"got a noospaper \" the colonel looked about in a flustered way for the tattered san francisco examiner potts and the boy hustled the punch bowl on to the bucket board recklessly spilling some of the precious contents o flynn and salmon p whisked the christmas tree into the corner and not even the boy remonstrated when a gingerbread man broke his neck and was trampled under foot quick the candles are going out shouted the boy and in truth each wick lay languishing in a little island of grease now flaring bravely now flickering to dusk it took some time to find in the san francisco examiner of august a foot square space that was whole but as quickly as possible the best bit was spread in the middle of the table dillon in the breathless silence having slowly untied the thongs held his sack aslant between the two lights and poured out a stream nuggets and coarse bright gold the crowd about the table drew audible breath nobody actually spoke at first except o flynn who said reverently \"be the siven howly pipers that danced at me gran mother s weddin when the divvle called the chune \" even the swimming wicks flared up and seemed to reach out each a hungry tongue of flame to touch and taste the glittering heap before they went into the dark low exclamations hands thrust out to feel and drawn back in a sort of superstitious awe here it was this wonderful stuff they d come for each one knew by the wild excitement in his own breast how in secret he had been brought to doubt its being here but here it was lying in a heap on the big cabin table and now it was gone the right candle had given out and o flynn blowing with impatience like a walrus had simultaneously extinguished the other for an instant a group of men with strained and dazzled eyes still bent above the blackness on the boards stir the fire called the colonel and flew to do it himself i ll light a piece of fat pine shouted the boy catching up a stick and thrusting it into the coals where s your bitch said dillon calmly bitch haven t you got a condensed milk can with some bacon grease in it and a rag wick makes a good enough light but the fire had been poked up and the cabin was full of dancing lights and shadows besides that the boy was holding a resinous stick alight over the table and they all bent down as before it was passin a bank in frisco wid a windy full o that stuff that brought me up here said o flynn it was hearin about that winder brought me added potts everyone longed to touch and feel about in the glittering pile but no one as yet had dared to lay a finger on the smallest grain in the hoard an electrical shock flashed through the company when the general picked up one of the biggest nuggets and threw it down with a rich full bodied thud \"that one is four ounces \" he took up another this is worth about sixty dollars more like forty said dillon they were of every conceivable shape and shapelessness most of them flattened some of them the greenhorn would swear were fashioned by man into roughly embossed hearts or shells or polished discs like rude defaced coins one was a perfect staple another the letter \"l another like an axe head and one like a peasant s sabot some were almost black with iron stains and some were set with jewels\" of quartz but for the most part they were formless fragments of a rich and brassy yellow lots of the little fellas are like melon seeds and the boy pointed a shaking finger longing and still not daring to touch the treasure each man had a dim feeling in the back of his head that after all the hillock of gold was an illusion and his own hand upon the dazzling pile would clutch the empty air where s your dust asked the boy dillon stared why here this is all nuggets and grains well what more do you want oh it d do well enough for me but it ain t dust it s what we call dust as coarse as this the sour dough nodded and lighter laughed there s a fox s mask said the colonel at the bottom of the table pointing a triangular bit out let me look at it a minute begged the boy hand it round whispered schiff it was real it was gold their fingers tingled under the first contact this was the beginning the rude bit of metal bred a glorious confidence under the magic of its touch robert bruce s expensive education became a simple certainty in potts s hand the nugget gave birth to a mighty progeny he saw himself pouring out sackfuls before his enraptured girl the boy lifted his flaring torch with a victorious sense of having just bought back the orange grove and salmon p passed the nugget to his partner with a blissful sigh well i m glad we didn t get cold feet says he yes whispered schiff \"it looks like we goin to the right place \" the sheen of the heap of yellow treasure was trying even to the nerves of the colonel put it away he said quite solemnly laying the nugget on the paper \"put it all away before the firelight dies down \" dillon leisurely gathered it up and dropped the nuggets with an absent minded air into the pouch which lighter held but the san francisco examiner had been worn to the softness of an old rag and the thinness of tissue under dillon s sinewy fingers pinching up the gold the paper gave way oh exclaimed more than one voice as at some grave mishap dillon improvised a scoop out of a dirty envelope nobody spoke and everybody watched and when finally with his hand he brushed the remaining grains off the torn paper into the envelope poured them into the gaping sack mouth and lazily pulled at the buckskin draw string everybody sat wondering how much if any of the precious metal had escaped through the tear and how soon dillon would come out of his brown study remember and recover the loss but a spell seemed to have fallen on the company no one spoke till dillon with that lazy motion hoisting one square shoulder and half turning his body round was in the act of returning the sack to his hip pocket wait said mac with the explosiveness of a firearm and o flynn jumped you ain t got it all whispered schiff hurriedly oh i m leavin the fox face for luck dillon nodded at the colonel but schiff pointed reverently at the tear in the paper as dillon only went on pushing his sack deep down in his pocket while mac lifted the examiner all but the two millionaires bent forward and scrutinised the table o flynn impulsively ran one lone hand over the place where the gold heap had lain his other hand held ready at the table s edge to catch any sweepings none but the result of o flynn s action was that those particles of gold that that fallen through the paper were driven into the cracks and inequalities of the board there see now look what you ve done mac pointed out a rough knot hole too that slyly held back a pinch of gold oh that dillon slapped his hip and settled into his place but the men nearest the crack and the knot hole fell to digging out the renegade grains and piously offering them to their lawful owner that ain t worth botherin about laughed dillon \"you always reckon to lose a little each time even if you got a china soup plate \" plenty more where that came from said the general easily such indifference was felt to be magnificent indeed the little incident said more for the richness of min ok than all the general s blowing they forgot that what was lost would amount to less than fifty cents the fact that it was gold min ok gold gave it a symbolic value not to be computed in coin how do you go asked the colonel as the two millionaires began putting on their things we cut across to kuskoquim take on an indian guide there to nushagak and from there with dogs across the ocean ice to kadiak oh the way the letters go out when they do smiled dillon \"yes it s the old russian post trail i believe south of kadiak island the sea is said to be open as early as the first of march we ll get a steamer to sitka and from sitka of course the boats run regular \" seattle by the middle of march says the general \"come along dillon the sooner you get to seattle and blow in a couple o hundred thousand the sooner you ll get back to min ok \" dillon went out and roused up the dogs asleep in the snow with their bushy tails sheltering their sharp noses see you later yes outside outside no sir inside dillon swore a blood curdling string of curses and cracked his whip over the leader why you comin back bet your life and nobody who looked at the face of the yukon pioneer could doubt he meant what he said they went indoors the cabin wore an unwonted and a rakish air the stools seemed to have tried to dance the lancers and have fallen out about the figure two were overturned the unwashed dishes were tossed helter skelter a tipsy christmas tree leaned in drunken fashion against the wall and under its boughs lay a forgotten child asleep on the other side of the cabin an empty whisky bottle caught a ray of light from the fire and glinted feebly back among the ashes on the hearth was a screw of paper charred at one end and thrown there after lighting someone s pipe the boy opened it the famous programme of the yukon symposium it s been a different sort of christmas from what we planned observed the colonel not quite as gaily as you might expect begob says o flynn stretching out his interminable legs \"ye can t say we haven t hearrd glad tidings of gr reat j y \" colonel interrupts the boy throwing the programme in the fire let s look at your nugget again and they all took turns except potts he was busy digging the remaining gold grains out of the crack and the knothole chapter ix a christian agnostic \" giver mig rum himlen bar stjerner natten er stum \" it was a good many days before they got the dazzle of that gold out of their eyes they found their tongues again and talked \"min ok\" from morning till night among themselves and with the rare passer up or down the trail mac began to think they might get dogs at anvik or at one of the ingalik villages a little further on the balance of opinion in the camp was against this view but he had potts on his side when the new year opened the trail was in capital condition on the second of january two lots of indians passed one with dogs hauling flour and bacon for benham and the other lot without dogs dragging light hand sleds potts said restlessly after all they can do it so can we if we ve a mind to said mac come on then the camp tried hard to dissuade them naturally neither listened they packed the boy s sled and set off on the morning of the third to kaviak s unbounded surprise and disgust his view of life being that wherever mac went he was bound to follow and he did follow made off as hard as his swift little feet could carry him straight up the yukon trail and farva lost a good half of that first morning bringing him home just eight days later the two men walked into the cabin and sat down potts with a heart rending groan mac with his jaw almost dislocated in his cast iron attempt to set his face against defeat their lips were cracked with the cold their faces raw from frostbite their eyes inflamed the weather they called it the weather had been too much for them it was obvious they hadn t brought back any dogs but what did you think of anvik says the boy anvik you don t suppose we got to anvik in weather like this how far did you get mac didn t answer potts only groaned he had frozen his cheek and his right hand they were doctored and put to bed did you see my friends at holy cross the boy asked potts when he brought him a bowl of hot bean soup you don t suppose we got as far as holy cross with the wind well where did you get to where you been second native village above why that isn t more n sixteen miles sixteen miles too far potts breathed long and deep between hot and comforting swallows where s the boy s sled said the colonel coming in hurriedly we cached it answered potts feebly couldn t even bring his sled home where ve you cached it it s all right only a few miles back potts relinquished the empty soup bowl and closed his eyes when he opened them again late in the evening it was to say found some o those suckers who were goin so slick to min ok some o them down at the second village and the rest are winterin in anvik so the indians say not a single son of a gun will see the diggins till the ice goes out then badly off as we are here says the colonel to the boy \"it s lucky for us we didn t join the procession \" when mac and the boy brought the sled home a couple of days later it was found that a portion of its cargo consisted of a toy kyak and two bottles of hootchino the maddening drink concocted by the natives out of fermented dough and sugar apart from the question of drinking raised again by the \"hootch it is perhaps possible that having so little else to do they were ready to eat the more it is also true that busy or idle the human body requires more nourishment in the north than it does in the south certainly the men of the little yukon camp began to find their rations horribly short commons and to suffer a continual hunger never wholly appeased it is conditions like these that bring out the brute latent in all men the day came to mean three scant meals each meal came to mean a silent struggle in each man s soul not to let his stomach get the better of his head and heart at first they joked and laughed about their hunger and the scarcity by and by it became too serious the jest was wry faced and rang false they had in the beginning each helped himself from common dishes set in the middle of the rough plank table later each found how without meaning to hating himself for it he watched food on its way to others plates with an evil eye when it came to his turn he had an ever recurrent struggle with himself not to take the lion s share there were ironical comments now and then and ill concealed bitterness no one of the five would have believed he could feel so towards a human being about a morsel of food but those who think they would be above it have not wintered in the arctic regions or fought in the boer war the difficulty was frankly faced at last and it was ordained in council that the colonel should be dispenser of the food can t say i like the office quoth he but here goes \" and he cut the bacon with an anxious hand and spooned out the beans solemnly as if he weighed each \"go \" and the trio presently retired to the little cabin to discuss whether the colonel didn t show favouritism to the boy and when mac was asleep how they could get rid of kaviak so presently another council was called and the colonel resigned his office stipulating that each man in turn should hold it for a week and learn how ungrateful it was moreover that whoever was for the nonce occupying the painful post should be loyally upheld by all the others which arrangement was in force to the end and still on grounds political religious social trivial the disaffection grew two of the trio sided against the odd man potts and turned him out of the little cabin one night during a furious snowstorm that had already lasted two days had more than half buried the hut and nearly snowed up the little doorway the colonel and the boy had been shovelling nearly all the day before to keep free the entrance to the big cabin and the precious \"bottle\" window as well as their half of the path between the two dwellings o flynn and potts had played poker and quarrelled as usual the morning after the ejection of potts and his unwilling reception at the big cabin mac and o flynn failed to appear for breakfast guess they re huffy says potts stretching out his feet very comfortable in their straw lined mucklucks before the big blaze bring on the coffee kaviak no says the colonel \"we won t begin without the other fellows \" by the living jingo i will then says potts and helps himself under the colonel s angry eyes the other two conferred a moment then drew on their parkis and mittens and with great difficulty in spite of yesterday s work got the door open it was pretty dark but there was no doubt about it the little cabin had disappeared look isn t that a curl of smoke said the boy yes by george they re snowed under serve em right a heavy sigh from the colonel \"yes but we ll have to dig em out \" look here colonel the boy spoke with touching solemnity \" not before breakfast \" right you are laughed the colonel and they went in it was that day after the others had been released and fed that the boy fell out with potts concerning who had lost the hatchet and they came to blows a black eye and a bloody nose might not seem an illuminating contribution to the question but no more was said about the hatchet after the colonel had dragged the boy off the prostrate form of his adversary but the colonel himself lost his temper two days later when o flynn broached the seal set months before on the nearly empty demijohn for those famous \"temperance punches\" the colonel had drawn on his own small stock he saw his blunder when o flynn possessing himself of the demijohn roared out it s my whisky i tell you i bought it and paid furr it and but for me it would be at the bottom o the yukon now yes and you d be at the bottom of the yukon yourself if you hadn t been dragged out by the scruff o your neck and you d be in a pretty fix now if we left you alone with your whisky which is about all you ve got we agreed potts chipped in \"that it should be kept for medicinal purposes only \" sullenly o flynn sipped at his grog potts had \"hogged most of the hootch \" look here boy said mac at supper \"i said i wouldn t eat off this plate again \" oh dry up one tin plate s like another tin plate are you reflecting on the washer up mr maccann asked potts i m saying what i ve said before that i ve scratched my name on my plate and i won t eat off this rusty battered kettle lid he held it up as if to shy it at the boy the young fellow turned with a flash in his eye and stood taut then in the pause he said quite low let her fly maccann but maccann thought better of it he threw the plate down on the table with a clatter the colonel jumped up and bent over the mush pot at the fire beside the boy whispering to him oh all right when the boy turned back to the table with the smoking kettle the cloud had gone from his face maccann had got up to hang a blanket over the door while his back was turned the boy brought a tin plate still in good condition set it down at mac s place planted a nail on end in the middle and with three blows from a hammer fastened the plate firmly to the board maybe you can t hand it up for more as often as you like but you ll always find it there he said when mccann came back and the laugh went against the dainty pioneer who to the end of the chapter ate from a plate nailed fast to the table i begin to understand says the colonel to the boy under cover of the others talk \"why it s said to be such a devil of a test of a fellow s decency to winter in this infernal country \" they say it s always a man s pardner he comes to hate most returned the boy laughing good humouredly at the colonel naturally look at the row in the little cabin that hasn t been the only row the boy went on more thoughtfully \"i say colonel\" he lowered his voice \"do you know there ll have to be a new system of rations i ve been afraid now i m sure the grub won t last till the ice goes out \" i know it said the colonel very gravely was there a miscalculation i hope it was that or else speaking still lower \"the stores have been tampered with and not by kaviak either there ll be a hell of a row \" he looked up and saw potts watching them suspiciously it had come to this if two men talked low the others pricked their ears \"but lack of grub resumed the colonel in his usual voice as though he had not noticed is only one of our difficulties lack of work is just about as bad it breeds a thousand devils we re a pack o fools here we are all of us hard hit some of us pretty well cleaned out o ready cash and here s dollars and dollars all round us and we sit over the fire like a lot of god forsaken natives \" dollars where growin on the trees boys a forest full oh timber enthusiasm cooled look at what they say about those fellows up at anvik what they made last year they ve got a saw mill now they have but they cut and sold cord wood to the steamers two years before they got a mill and next summer will be the biggest season yet we ought to have set to as soon as the cabins were built and cut wood for the summer traffic but since there are five of us we can make a good thing of it yet the colonel finally carried the day they went at it next morning and as the projector of the work had privately predicted a better spirit prevailed in the camp for some time but here were five men only one of whom had had any of the steadying grace of stiff discipline in his life men of haphazard education who had \"chucked\" more or less easy berths in a land of many creature comforts for this to fell and haul birch and fir trees in an arctic climate on half rations it began to be apparent that the same spirit was invading the forest that had possession of the camp two or at most three did the work and the rest shirked got snow blindness and rheumatism and let the others do his share counting securely nevertheless on his fifth of the proceeds just as he counted no matter what proportion he had contributed on his full share of the common stock of food i came out here a communist said the boy one day to the colonel and an agnostic smiled the older man oh i m an agnostic all right now and for ever but this winter has cured my faith in communism early february brought not only lengthening daylight but a radical change in the weather the woodsmen worked in their shirt sleeves perspired freely and said in the innocence of their hearts \"if winter comes early up here spring does the same \" the whole hillside was one slush and the snow melting on the ill made little cabin roof brought a shower bath into the upper bunk few things in nature so surely stir the pulse of man as the untimely coming of a few spring days that have lost their way in the calendar and wandered into winter no trouble now to get the big chimney men away from the fireside they held up their bloodless faces in the faint sunshine and their eyes with the pupils enlarged by the long reign of night blinked feebly like an owl s forced to face the morning there were none of those signs in the animal world outside of premature stir and cheerful awaking that in other lands help the illusion that winter lies behind but there was that even more stimulating sweet air abroad that subtle mixture of sun and yielding frost that softened wind that comes blowing across the snow still keen to the cheek but subtly reviving to the sensitive nostril and caressing to the eyes the big chimney men drew deep breaths and said in their hearts the battle was over and won kaviak for ever following at mac s heels \"like a rale irish tarrier found his allegiance waver in these stirring blissful days if ever farva so belied character and custom as to swing an axe for any length of time plainly out of patience kaviak would throw off the musk rat coat and run about in wet mucklucks and a single garment uphill downhill on important errands which he confided to no man it is part of the sorcery of such days that men s thoughts like birds turn to other places impatient of the haven that gave them shelter in rough weather overpast the big chimney men leaned on their axes and looked north south east west then the colonel would give a little start turn about lift his double bitter and swing it frontier fashion first over one shoulder then over the other striking cleanly home each time working with a kind of splendid rhythm more harmonious more beautiful to look at than most of the works of men this was perhaps the view of his comrades for they did a good deal of looking at the colonel he said he was a modest man and didn t like it and mac turning a little rusty under the gibe answered haven t you got the sense to see we ve cut all the good timber just round here \" and again he turned his eyes to the horizon line mac s right said the boy and even the colonel stood still a moment and they all looked away to that land at the end of the world where the best materials are for the building of castles it s the same country so plainly pointed out by the rainbow s end and never so much as in the springtime does it lure men with its ancient promise come along colonel let s go and look for real timber and let s find it nearer water level where the steamers can see it right away what about the kid me come said kaviak with a highly obliging air no you stay at home no go too go too thou babbler kaviak s a better trail man than some i could mention we ll have to carry him home objected potts now don t tell us you ll do any of the carryin or we ll lose confidence in you potts the trail was something awful but on their canadian snowshoes they got as far as an island six miles off one end of it was better wooded than any easily accessible place they had seen why this is quite like real spruce said the boy and o flynn admitted that even in california \"these here would be called trees wid no intintion o bein sarcaustic \" so they cut holes in the ice and sounded for the channel yes sir the steamers can make a landin here and here s where we ll have our wood rack they went home in better spirits than they had been in since that welter of gold had lain on the big cabin table but a few days sufficed to wear the novelty off the new wood camp for most of the party potts and o flynn set out in the opposite direction one morning with a hand sled and provisions to last several days they were sick of bacon and beans and were \"goin huntin \" no one could deny that a moose or even a grouse anything in the shape of fresh meat was sufficiently needed but potts and o flynn were really sick and sore from their recent slight attack of wood felling they were after bigger game too as well as grouse and a few days \"off \" it had turned just enough colder to glaze the trail and put it in fine condition they went down the river to the oklahoma were generously entertained by captain rainey and learned that with earlier contracts on his hands he did not want more wood from them than they had already corded they returned to the camp without game but with plenty of whisky and information that freed them from the yoke of labour and from the lash of ironic comment in vain the colonel urged that the oklahoma was not the only steamer plying the yukon that with the big rush of the coming season the traffic would be enormous and a wood pile as good as a gold mine the cause was lost you won t get us to make galley slaves of ourselves on the off chance of selling rainey says that wood camps have sprung up like mushrooms all along the river the price of wood will go down to all along the river there isn t one between us and andreievsky nor between here and holy cross but it was no use the travellers pledged each other in oklahoma whisky and making a common cause once more the original trio put in a night of it the boy and the colonel turned into their bunks at eleven o clock they were roused in the small hours by kaviak s frightened crying and the noise of angry voices you let the kid alone well it s mesilf that ll take the liberty o mintionin that i ain t goin to stand furr another minyit an esquimer s cuttin down my rations sure it s a fool i ve been you can t help that mac chopped out say mac said potts in a drunken voice \"i m talkin to you like a friend you want to get a move on that kid \" kaviak s goin won t make any more difference than a fly s the other two grumbled incoherently but i tell you what would make a difference if you two would quit eatin on the sly out o meal times be the siven you lie a movement a stool overturned and the two men in the bunks were struck broad awake by the smart concussion of a gun shot nobody was hurt and between them they disarmed potts and turned the irishman out to cool off in his own cabin it was all over in a minute kaviak reassured curled down to sleep again mac and potts stretched themselves on the buffalo robe half under the table and speedily fell to snoring the boy put on some logs he and the colonel sat and watched the sparks it s a bad business it can t go on says the colonel \"but mac s right kaviak s being here isn t to blame they we too are like a lot of powder cans \" the boy nodded \"any day a spark and biff some of us are in a blaze and wh tt bang and some of us are in kingdom come \" i begin to be afraid to open my lips said the colonel \"we all are don t you notice \" yes i wonder why we came you had no excuse said the elder man almost angrily same excuse as you the colonel shook his head exactly maintained the boy \"tired of towns and desk work and and \" the boy shifted about on his wooden stool and held up his hands to the reviving blaze \"life owes us steady fellows one year of freedom anyhow one year to make ducks and drakes of besides we ve all come to make our fortunes doesn t every mother s son of us mean to find a gold mine in the spring when we get to the klondyke eh \" and he laughed again and presently he yawned and tumbled back into his bunk but he put his head out in a moment \"aren t you going to bed \" yes the colonel stood up did you know father wills went by last night when those fellows began to row about getting out the whisky no he says there s another stampede on where to koyukuk this time why didn t he come in awful hurry to get to somebody that sent for him funny fellas these jesuits they believe all those odd things they teach so do other men said the colonel curtly well i ve lived in a christian country all my life but i don t know that i ever saw christianity practised till i went up the yukon to holy cross i must say you re complimentary to the few other christians scattered about the world don t get mifft colonel i ve known plenty of people straight as a die and capital good fellows i ve seen them do very decent things now and then but with these jesuit missionaries lord there s no let up to it no answer from the protestant colonel presently the boy in a sleepy voice added elegantly no siree the jesuits go the whole hog winter was down on the camp again the whole world was hard as iron the men kept close to the big chimney all day long and sat there far into the small hours of the morning saying little heavy eyed and sullen the dreaded insomnia of the arctic had laid hold on all but the colonel even his usually unbroken repose was again disturbed one night about a week later some vague sort of sound or movement in the room kaviak on a raid or wasn t that the closing of a door kaviak he put his hand down and felt the straight hair of the esquimaux in the under bunk \"potts who s there \" he half sat up boy did you hear that boy he leaned far down over the side and saw distinctly by the fire light there was nobody but kaviak in the under bunk the colonel was on his legs in a flash putting his head through his parki and drawing on his mucklucks he didn t wait to cross and tie the thongs a presentiment of evil was strong upon him outside in the faint star light he thought a dim shape was passing down towards the river who s that hi there stop or i ll shoot he hadn t brought his gun but the ruse worked don t shoot came back the voice of the boy the colonel stumbled down the bank in the snow and soon stood by the shape the boy was dressed for a journey his arctic cap was drawn down over his ears and neck the wolf skin fringe of his parki hood stood out fiercely round the defiant young face wound about one of his seal skin mittens was the rope of the new hand sled he d been fashioning so busily of nights by the camp fire his two blankets were strapped on the sled indian fashion along with a gunny sack and his rifle the two men stood looking angrily at each other a moment and then the colonel politely inquired what in hell are you doing goin to min ok the devil you are yes the devil i am they stood measuring each other in the dim light till the colonel s eyes fell on the loaded sled the boy s followed i ve only taken short rations for two weeks i left a statement in the cabin it s about a fifth of what s my share so there s no need of a row what are you goin for why to be first in the field and stake a gold mine of course the colonel laid a rough hand on the boy s shoulder he shook it off impatiently and before the older man could speak look here let s talk sense somebody s got to go or there ll be trouble potts says kaviak but what difference would kaviak make i ve been afraid you d get ahead of me i ve watched you for a week like a hawk watches a chicken but it s clear i m the one to go he pulled up the rope of the sled and his little cargo lurched towards him the colonel stepped in front of him boy he began but something was the matter with his voice he got no further i m the youngest boasted the other \"and i m the strongest and i m the hungriest \" the colonel found a perturbed and husky voice in which to say i didn t know you were such a christian nothin o the sort what s this but why it s just just my little scheme you re no fool you know as well as i do you ve got the devil s own job in hand somebody s got to go he repeated doggedly look here said the colonel \"you haven t impressed me as being tired of life \" tired of life the young eyes flashed in that weird aureole of long wolf hair \"tired of life well i should just pretty nearly think i wasn t \" h m then if it isn t christianity it must be because you re young golly man it s because i m hungry hungry great jehosaphat i could eat an ox and you leave your grub behind to be eaten by a lot of i can t stand here argyfying with the thermometer down to the boy began to drag the sled over the snow come back into the cabin no come with me i say i ve got something to propose again the colonel stood in front barring the way \"look here he went on gently are you a friend of mine \" oh so so growled the boy but after looking about him for an angry second or two he flung down the rope of his sled walked sulkily uphill and kicked off his snow shoes at the door of the cabin all with the air of one who waits but is not baulked of his purpose they went in and stripped off their furs now see here if you ve made up your mind to light out i m not going to oppose you why didn t you say anything as sensible as that out yonder because i won t be ready to go along till to morrow you yep there was a little silence i wish you wouldn t colonel it s dangerous alone not for two yes it is dangerous and you know it i m goin along laddie seeing the boy look precious grave and harassed \"what s the matter \" i d hate awfully for anything to happen to you the colonel laughed \"much obliged but it matters uncommon little if i do drop in my tracks \" you be blowed you see i ve got a pretty bad kind of a complaint anyhow the boy leaned over in the firelight and scanned the colonel s face what s wrong the colonel smiled a queer little one sided smile \"i ve been out o kelter nearly ten years \" oh that s all right you ll go on for another thirty if you stay where you are till the ice goes out the colonel bent his head and stared at the smooth trodden floor at the edge of the buffalo skin \"to tell the truth i ll be glad to go not only because of \" he hitched his shoulders towards the corner whence came the hoarse and muffled breathing of the denver clerk \"i ll be glad to have something to tire me out so i ll sleep sleep too sound to dream that s what i came for not to sit idle in a god damn cabin and think think \" he got up suddenly and strode the tiny space from fire to door a man transformed with hands clenching and dark face almost evil \"they say the men who winter up here either take to drink or go mad i begin to see it is so it s no place to do any forgetting in \" he stopped suddenly before the boy with glittering eyes \"it s the country where your conscience finds you out \" that religion of yours is makin you morbid colonel the boy spoke with the detached and soothing air of a sage you don t know what you re talking about he turned sharply away the boy relapsed into silence the colonel in his renewed prowling brought up against the wooden crane he stood looking down into the fire loud and regular sounded the sleeping man s breathing in the quiet little room i did a wrong once to a woman ten years ago said the colonel speaking to the back log \"although i loved her \" he raised a hand to his eyes with a queer choking sound \"i loved her he repeated still with his back to the boy by and by i could have righted it but she she wasn t the kind to hang about and wait on a man s better nature when once he d shown himself a coward she skipped the country \" he leaned his head against the end of the shelf over the fire and said no more go back in the spring find out where she is and i ve spent every spring and every summer every fall and every winter till this one trying to do just that thing you can t find her nobody can find her she s dead she s not dead the boy involuntarily shrank back the colonel looked ready to smash him the action recalled the older man to himself i feel sure she isn t dead he said more quietly but still trembling \"no no she isn t dead she had some money of her own and she went abroad i followed her i heard of her in paris in rome i saw her once in a droschky in vienna there i lost the trail her people said she d gone to japan i went to japan i m sure she wasn t in the islands i ve spent my life since trying to find her writing her letters that always come back trying \" his voice went out like a candle wick suddenly dying in the socket only the sleeper was audible for full five minutes then as though he had paused only a comma s space the colonel went on \"i ve been trying to put the memory of her behind me as a sane man should but some women leave an arrow sticking in your flesh that you can never pull out you can only jar against it and cringe under the agony of the reminder all your life long bah go out boy and bring in your sled \" and the boy obeyed without a word two days after three men with a child stood in front of the larger cabin saying good bye to their two comrades who were starting out on snow shoes to do a little matter of miles of arctic travelling with two weeks scant provisioning some tea and things for trading bedding two rifles and a kettle all packed on one little hand sled there had been some unexpected feeling and even some real generosity shown at the last on the part of the three who were to profit by the exodus falling heir thereby to a bigger warmer cabin and more food o flynn was moved to make several touching remonstrances it was a sign of unwonted emotion on mac s part that he gave up arguing sacrificing all the delight of a set debate and simply begged and prayed them not to be fools not to fly in the face of providence but potts was made of sterner stuff besides the thing was too good to be true o flynn when he found they were not to be dissuaded solemnly presented each with a little bottle of whisky nobody would have believed o flynn would go so far as that nor could anyone have anticipated that close fisted mac would give the boy his valuable aneroid barometer and compass or that potts would be so generous with his best virginia straight cut filling the colonel s big pouch without so much as a word it s a crazy scheme says he shaking the giant kentuckian by the hand \"and you won t get thirty miles before you find it out \" call it an expedition to anvik urged mac \"load up there with reindeer meat and come back if we don t get some fresh meat soon we ll be having scurvy \" what you re furr doin says o flynn for the twentieth time \"has niver been done not ayven be indians the prastes ahl say so \" so do the sour doughs said mac \"it isn t as if you had dogs \" good bye said the colonel and the men grasped hands potts shook hands with the boy as heartily as though that same hand had never half throttled him in the cause of a missing hatchet good bye kiddie i bequeath you my share o syrup good bye meet you in the klondyke good bye hooray for the klondyke in june klondyke in june hoop la the two travellers looked back laughing and nodding as jolly as you please the boy stooped made a snow ball and fired it at kaviak the child ducked chuckling and returned as good as he got his loosely packed ball broke in a splash on the back of the boy s parki and kaviak was loudly cheered still as they went forward they looked back the big chimney wore an air wondrous friendly and the wide white world looked coldly at them with small pretence of welcome or reward i don t believe i ever really knew how awful jolly the big chimney was till this minute the colonel smiled \"hardly like myself to think whatever else i see i ll never see that again \" better not boast the colonel went on in front breaking trail in the newfallen snow the boy pulling the sled behind him as lightly as if its double burden were a feather they look as if they thought it d be a picnic says mac grimly i wonder be the siven howly pipers will we iver see ayther of em again if they only stay a couple o nights at anvik said potts with gloomy foreboding \"they could get back here inside a week \" no answered mac following the two figures with serious eyes \"they may be dead inside a week but they won t be back here \" and potts felt his anxiety eased a man who had mined at caribou ought to know chapter x princess muckluck \"we all went to tibbals to see the kinge who used my mother and my aunt very gratiouslie but we all saw a great chaunge betweene the fashion of the court as it was now and of y in ye queene s for we were all lowzy by sittinge in sr thomas erskin s chamber \" memoir anne countess of dorset it was the th of february that first day that they \"hit the long trail \" temperature only about twenty degrees the colonel thought and so little wind it had the effect of being warmer trail in fair condition weather gray and steady never men in better spirits to have left the wrangling and the smouldering danger of the camp behind that alone as the boy said was \"worth the price of admission \" exhilarating too to men of their temperament to have cut the gordian knot of the difficulty by risking themselves on this unprecedented quest for peace and food gold too oh yes with a smile to see how far that main object had drifted into the background they added \"and for gold \" they believed they had hearkened well to the counsel that bade them travel light \"remember every added ounce is against you \" \"nobody in the north owns anything that s heavy had been said in one fashion or another so often that it lost its ironic sound in the ears of men who had come so far to carry away one of the heaviest things under the sun the colonel and the boy took no tent no stove not even a miner s pick and pan these last general lighter had said could be obtained at min ok and there isn t a cabin on the trail dillon had added without em \" for the rest the carefully selected pack on the sled contained the marmot skin woollen blankets a change of flannels apiece a couple of sweaters a norfolk jacket and several changes of foot gear this last item was dwelt on earnestly by all \"keep your feet dry john dillon had said and leave the rest to god almighty \" they were taking barely two weeks rations and a certain amount of stuff to trade with the up river indians when their supplies should be gone they carried a kettle an axe some quinine a box of the carbolic ointment all miners use for foot soreness o flynn s whisky and two rifles and ammunition in spite of having eliminated many things that most travellers would count essential they found their load came to a little over two hundred pounds but every day would lessen it they told each other with a laugh and with an inward misgiving lest the lightening should come all too quickly they had seen in camp that winter so much of the frailty of human temper that although full of faith by now in each other s native sense and fairness they left nothing to a haphazard division of labour they parcelled out the work of the day with absolute impartiality to each man so many hours of going ahead to break trail if the snow was soft while the other dragged the sled or else while one pulled in front the other pushed from behind in regular shifts by the watch turn and turn about the colonel had cooked all winter so it was the boy s turn at that the colonel s to decide the best place to camp because it was his affair to find seasoned wood for fuel his to build the fire in the snow on green logs laid close together his to chop enough wood to cook breakfast the next morning all this they had arranged before they left the big chimney that they did not cover more ground that first day was a pure chance not likely to recur due to an unavoidable loss of time at pymeut knowing the fascination that place exercised over his companion the colonel called a halt about seven miles off from the big chimney that they might quickly despatch a little cold luncheon they carried in their pockets and push on without a break till supper we ve got no time to waste at pymeut observes the colonel significantly i ain t achin to stop at pymeut says his pardner with a superior air standing up as he swallowed his last mouthful of cold bacon and corn bread and cheerfully surveyed the waste \"who says it s cold even if the wind is up and the track s bully but see here colonel you mustn t go thinkin it s smooth glare ice like this all the way \" oh i was figurin that it would be but the boy paid no heed to the irony and it s a custom o the country to get the wind in your face as a rule whichever way you go well i m not complainin as yet reckon you needn t if you re blown like dandelion down all the way to min ok gee the wind s stronger say colonel let s rig a sail foolishness no sir we ll go by pymeut in an ice boat lickety split and it ll be a good excuse for not stopping though i think we ought to say good bye to nicholas this view inclined the colonel to think better of an ice boat he had once crossed the bay of toronto in that fashion and began to wonder if such a mode of progression applied to sleds might not aid largely in solving the min ok problem while he was wondering the boy unlashed the sled load and pulled off the canvas cover as the colonel came back with his mast between them with no better tools than axe jack knives and a rope and with fingers freezing in the south wind they rigged the sail the fact that they had this increasingly favourable wind on their very first day showed that they were specially smiled on by the great natural forces the superstitious feeling that only slumbers in most breasts that mother nature is still a mysterious being who has her favourites whom she guards her born enemies whom she baulks pursues and finally overwhelms the age old childishness stirred pleasantly in both men and in the younger came forth unabashed in speech i tell you the omens are good this expedition s goin to get there then with the involuntary misgiving that follows hard upon such boasting he laughed uneasily and added \"i mean to sacrifice the first deer s tongue i don t want myself to yukon inua but here s to the south wind \" he turned some corn bread crumbs out of his pocket and saw delighted how the gale grown keener snatched eagerly at them and hurried them up the trail the ice boat careened and strained eagerly to sail away the two gold seekers laughing like schoolboys sat astride the pack the colonel shook out the canvas and they scudded off up the river like mad the great difficulty was the steering but it was rip roaring fun the boy said and very soon there were natives running down to the river to stare open mouthed at the astounding apparition to point and shout something unintelligible that sounded like \"muchtaravik \" why it s the pymeuts pardner we ll be in min ok by supper ti the words hadn t left his lips when he saw a few yards in front of them a faint cloud of steam rising up from the ice that dim danger signal that flies above an air hole the colonel never noticing was heading straight for the ghastly trap god colonel blow hole gasped the boy the colonel simply rolled off the pack turning over and over on the ice but keeping hold of the rope the sled swerved turned on her side and slid along with a sound of snapping and tearing while they were still headed straight for the hole the boy had gathered himself for a clear jump to the right but the sled s sudden swerve to the left broke his angle sharply he was flung forward on the new impetus spun over the smooth surface swept across the verge and under the cloud clutching wildly at the ragged edge of ice as he went down all pymeut had come rushing pell mell the colonel was gathering himself up and looking round in a dazed kind of way as nicholas flashed by just beyond in that yawning hole fully ten feet wide by fifteen long the boy s head appeared an instant and then was lost like something seen in a dream some of the pymeuts with quick knives were cutting the canvas loose one end was passed to nicholas he knotted it to his belt and went swiftly but gingerly forward nearer the perilous edge he had flung himself down on his stomach just as the boy rose again nicholas lurched his body over the brink his arms outstretched straining farther farther yet till it seemed as if only the counterweight of the rest of the population at the other end of the canvas prevented his joining the boy in the hole but nicholas had got a grip of him and while two of the pymeuts hung on to the half stunned colonel to prevent his adding to the complication nicholas with a good deal of trouble in spite of yagorsha s help hauled the boy out of the hole and dragged him up on the ice edge the others applied themselves lustily to their end of the canvas and soon they were all at a safe distance from the yawning danger the boy s predominant feeling had been one of intense surprise he looked round and a hideous misgiving seized him anything the matter with you colonel his tone was so angry that as they stared at each other they both fell to laughing well i rather thought that was what i was going to say and kentucky heaved a deep sigh of relief the boy s teeth began to chatter and his clothes were soon freezing on him they got him up off the ice and nicholas and the sturdy old pymeut story teller yagorsha walked him or ran him rather the rest of the way to pymeut for they were not so near the village as the travellers had supposed on seeing nearly the whole male population the colonel was not far behind and several of the bucks were bringing the disabled sled before reaching the kachime they were joined by the women and children muckluck much concerned at the sight of her friend glazed in ice from head to heel nicholas and yagorsha half dragged half pulled him into the kachime the entire escort followed even two or three very dirty little boys everybody except the handful of women and girls left at the mouth of the underground entrance and the two men who had run on to make a fire it was already smoking viciously as though the seal lamps weren t doing enough in that line when yagorsha and nicholas laid the half frozen traveller on the sleeping bench the pymeuts knew that the great thing was to get the ice stiffened clothes off as quickly as might be and that is to be done expeditiously only by cutting them off in vain the boy protested recklessly they sawed and cut and stripped him rubbed him and wrapped him in a rabbit blanket the fur turned inside and a wolverine skin over that the colonel at intervals poured small doses of o flynn s whisky down the boy s throat in spite of his unbecoming behaviour for he was both belligerent and ungrateful complaining loudly of the ruin of his clothes with only such intermission as the teeth chattering swallowing and rude handling necessitated i didn t like bein in that blow hole do you know it was so cold it burnt but i d rather be in a blow hole than br r r blow hole isn t so s s melly as these s s kins you better be glad you ve got a whole skin of your own and ain t smellin brimstone said the colonel pouring a little more whisky down the unthankful throat pretty sort o klondyker you are go and get nearly drowned first day out \" several pymeut women came in presently and joined the men at the fire chattering low and staring at the colonel and the boy i can t go to the klondyke naked no nor wrapped in a rabbit skin like baby bunting nicholas was conferring with the colonel and offering to take him to ol chief s oh yes ol chief got two clo es you come me show and they crawled out one after the other you pretty near dead that time said one of the younger women conversationally that s right who are you anyway me anna yagorsha s daughter oh yes i thought i d seen you before she seemed to be only a little older than muckluck but less attractive chiefly on account of her fat and her look of ill temper she was on specially bad terms with a buck they called joe and they seemed to pass all their time abusing one another the boy craned his neck and looked round except just where he was lying the pymeut men and women were crowded together on that side of the kachime at his head and at his feet thick as herrings on a thwart they all leaned forward and regarded him with a beady eyed sympathy he had never been so impressed by the fact before but all these native people even in their gentlest moods frowned in a chronic perplexity and wore their wide mouths open he reflected that he had never seen one that didn t except muckluck here she was crawling in with a tin can got something there to eat the rescued one craned his head as far as he could too soon she said showing her brilliant teeth in the fire light she set the tin down looked round a little embarrassed and stirred the fire which didn t need it well he put his chin down under the rabbit skin once more \"how goes the world princess \" she flashed her quick smile again and nodded reassuringly \"you stay here now \" no goin up river what for she spoke disapprovingly want to get an orange grove find him up river hope so i think i go too and all the grave folk sitting so close on the sleeping bench stretched their wide mouths wider still smiling good humouredly you better wait till summer oh she lifted her head from the fire as one who takes careful note of instructions \"nex summer \" well summer s the time for squaws to travel i come nex summer she said by and by nicholas returned with a new parki and a pair of wonderful buckskin breeches not like anything worn by the lower river natives or by the coast men either well cut well made and handsomely fringed down the outside of the leg where an officer s gold stripe goes chaparejos screamed the boy \"where d you get em \" ol chief he ketch um they re bully said the boy holding the despised rabbit skin under his chin with both hands and craning excitedly over it he felt that his fortunes were looking up talk about a tide in the affairs of men why a tide that washes up to a wayfarer s feet a pair o chaparejos like that well legs so habited would simply have to carry a fella on to fortune he lay back on the sleeping bench with dancing eyes while the raw whisky hummed in his head in the dim light of seal lamps vague visions visited him of stern and noble chiefs out of the leather stocking stories of his childhood men of daring whose legs were invariably cased in buck skin with dangling fringes but the dashing race was not all indian nor all dead famous cowboys reared before him on bucking bronchos their leg fringes streaming on the blast and desperate chaps who held up coaches and potted wells fargo guards anybody must needs be a devil of a fellow who went about in \"shaps as his california cousins called chaparejos even a peaceable fella like himself not out after gore at all but after an orange grove even he once he put on he laughed out loud at his childishness and then grew grave say nicholas what s the tax \" hey how much oh your pardner he pay humph i s pose i ll know the worst on settlin day then after a few moments making a final clutch at economy before the warmth and the whisky subdued him altogether say nicholas have you got hasn t the ol chief got any less glorious breeches than those hey anything little cheaper nuh says nicholas the boy closed his eyes relieved on the whole fate had a mind to see him in chaparejos let her look to the sequel then when consciousness came back it brought the sound of yagorsha s yarning by the fire and the occasional laugh or grunt punctuating the eternal story the colonel was sitting there among them solacing himself by adding to the smoke that thickened the stifling air presently the story teller made some shrewd hit that shook the pymeut community into louder grunts of applause and a general chuckling the colonel turned his head slowly and blew out a fresh cloud \"good joke \" in the pause that fell thereafter yagorsha imperturbable the only one who had not laughed smoothed his lank iron gray locks down on either side of his wide face and went on renewing the sinew open work in his snow shoe when ol chief s father die all the pymeuts chuckled afresh the boy listened eagerly usually yagorsha s stories were tragic or at least of serious interest ranging from bereaved parents who turned into wolverines all the way to the machinations of the horrid dwarf and the cannibal old woman the colonel looked at nicholas he seemed as entertained as the rest but quite willing to leave his family history in professional hands ol chief s father glovotsky him russian yagorsha began again laying down his sinew thread a moment and accepting some of the colonel s tobacco i didn t know you had any white blood in you interrupted the colonel offering his pouch to nicholas \"i might have suspected muckluck \" heap got russian blood interrupted joe as the story teller seemed to be about to repeat the enlivening tradition concerning the almost mythical youth of ol chief s father that subject of the great katharine s whose blood was flowing still in pymeut veins just then in came yagorsha s daughter with some message to her father he grunted acquiescence and she turned to go joe called something after her and she snapped back he jumped up to bar her exit she gave him a smart cuff across the eyes which surprised him almost into the fire and while he was recovering his equilibrium she fled yagorsha and all the pymeuts laughed delightedly at joe s discomfiture the boy had been obliged to sit up to watch this spirited encounter the only notice the colonel took of him was to set the kettle on the fire while he was dining his pardner gathered up the blankets and crawled out comin in half a minute the boy called after him the answer was swallowed by the tunnel him go say goo bye ol chief said nicholas observing how the colonel s pardner was scalding himself in his haste to despatch a second cup of tea but the boy bolted the last of his meal gathered up the kettle mug and frying pan which had served him for plate as well and wormed his way out as fast as he could there was the sled nearly packed for the journey and watching over it keeping the dogs at bay was an indescribably dirty little boy in a torn and greasy denim parki over rags of reindeer skin nobody else in sight but yagorsha s daughter down at the water hole where s my pardner gone the child only stared having no english apparently while the boy packed the rest of the things and made the tattered canvas fast under the lashing joe came out of the kachime he stood studying the prospect a moment and his dull eyes suddenly gleamed anna was coming up from the river with her dripping pail he set off with an affectation of leisurely indifference but he made straight for his enemy she seemed not to see him till he was quite near then she sheered off sharply joe hardly quickened his pace but seemed to gain she set down her bucket and turned back towards the river idiot ejaculated the boy \"she could have reached her own ighloo \" the dirty child grinned and tore off towards the river to watch the fun anna was hidden now by a pile of driftwood the boy ran down a few yards to bring her within range again for all his affectation of leisureliness and her obvious fluster no doubt about it joe was gaining on her she dropped her hurried walk and frankly took to her heels joe doing the same but as she was nearly as fleet of foot as muckluck in spite of her fat she still kept a lessening distance between herself and her pursuer the ragged child had climbed upon the pile of drift wood and stood hunched with the cold his shoulders up to his ears his hands withdrawn in his parki sleeves but he was grinning still the boy a little concerned as to possible reprisals upon so impudent a young woman had gone on and on watching the race down to the river and even across the ice a little way he stood still an instant staring as joe going now as hard as he could caught up with her at last he took hold of the daughter of the highly respected yagorsha and fell to shaking and cuffing her the boy started off full tilt to the rescue before he could reach them joe had thrown her down on the ice she half got up but her enemy advancing upon her again dealt her a blow that made her howl and sent her flat once more stop that you hear stop it the boy called out but joe seemed not to hear anna had fallen face downward on the ice this time and lay there as if stunned her enemy caught hold of her pulled her up and dragged her along in spite of her struggles and cries let her alone the boy shouted he was nearly up to them now but joe s attention was wholly occupied in hauling anna back to the village maltreating her at intervals by the way now the girl was putting up one arm piteously to shield her bleeding face from his fists \"don t you hit her again or it ll be the worse for you \" but again joe s hand was lifted the boy plunged forward caught the blow as it descended and flung the arm aside wrenched the girl free and as joe came on again looking as if he meant business the boy planted a sounding lick on his jaw the pymeut staggered and drew off a little way looking angry enough but to the boy s surprise showing no fight it occurred to him that the girl her lip bleeding her parki torn seemed more surprised than grateful and when he said \"you come back with me he shan t touch you she did not show the pleased alacrity that you would expect but she was no doubt still dazed they all stood looking rather sheepish and like actors stuck\" who cannot think of the next line till joe turned on the girl with some mumbled question she answered angrily he made another grab at her she screamed and got behind the boy very resolutely he widened his bold buck skin legs and dared joe to touch the poor frightened creature cowering behind her protector again silence what s the trouble between you two they looked at each other and then away joe turned unexpectedly and shambled off in the direction of the village not a word out of anna as she returned by the side of her protector but every now and then she looked at him sideways the boy felt her inexpressive gratitude and was glad his journey had been delayed or else poor devil joe had stopped to speak to who on earth s that white woman nicholas sister not muckluck she nodded what s she dressed like that for often like that in summer me too me got holy cross clo es muckluck went slowly up towards the kachime with joe when the others got to the water hole anna turned and left the boy without a word to go and recover her pail the boy stood a moment looking for some sign of the colonel and then went along the river bank to ol chief s no the colonel had gone back to the kachime the boy came out again and to his almost incredulous astonishment there was joe dragging the unfortunate anna towards an ighloo as he looked back to steer straight for the entrance hole he caught sight of the boy dropped his prey and disappeared with some precipitancy into the ground when anna had gathered herself up the boy was standing in front of her you don t seem to be able to take very good care o yourself she pushed her tousled hair out of her eyes \"i don t wonder your own people give it up if you have to be rescued every half hour what s the matter with you and joe \" she kept looking down \"what have you done to make him like this \" she looked up suddenly and laughed and then her eyes fell done nothin why should he want to kill you then no kill she said smiling a little rueful and embarrassed again with her eyes on the ground then as the boy still stood there waiting \"joe she whispered glancing over her shoulder joe want me be he squaw \" the boy fell back an astonished step jee rusalem he s got a pretty way o sayin so why don t you tell your father tell father it seemed never to have occurred to her yes can t yagorsha protect you she looked about doubtfully and then over her shoulder that joe s ighloo she said he pictured to himself the horror that must assail her blood at the sight yes he was glad to have saved any woman from so dreadful a fate did it happen often and did nobody interfere muckluck was coming down from the direction of the kachime the boy went to meet her throwing over his shoulder \"you d better stick to me anna as long as i m here i don t know i m sure what ll happen to you when i m gone \" anna followed a few paces and then sat down on the snow to pull up and tie her disorganized leg gear muckluck was standing still looking at the boy with none of the kindness a woman ought to show to one who had just befriended her sex did you see that she nodded \"see that any day \" the boy stopped appalled at the thought of woman in a perpetual state of siege brute hound he flung out towards joe s ighloo no says muckluck firmly \"joe all right \" you say that after what s happened this morning muckluck declined to take the verdict back \"did you see him strike her \" no hurt oh didn t it he threw her down as hard as he could on the ice she get up again he despised muckluck in that moment you weren t sorry to see another girl treated so she smiled what if it had been you oh he not do that to me why not you can t tell oh yes she spoke with unruffled serenity it will very likely be you the next time the boy took a brutal pleasure in presenting the hideous probability no she returned unmoved \"joe savvy i no marry pymeut \" the boy stared mystified by the lack of sequence \"poor anna doesn t want to marry that pymeut \" muckluck nodded the boy gave her up perversity was not confined to the civilized of her sex he walked on to find the colonel muckluck followed but the boy wouldn t speak to her wouldn t look at her you like my holy cross clo es she inquired \"me i look like your kind of girls now huh \" no answer but she kept up with him \"see \" she held up proudly a medallion or coin of some sort hung on a narrow strip of raw hide he meant not to look at it at all and he jerked his head away after the merest glance that showed him the ornament was tarnished silver a little bigger than an american dollar and bore no device familiar to his eyes he quickened his pace and walked on with face averted the colonel appeared just below the kachime well aren t you ever comin he called out i ve been ready this half hour hangin about waitin for you that devil joe he went on lowering his voice as he came up and speaking hurriedly \"has been trying to drag yagorsha s girl into his ighloo they ve just had a fight out yonder on the ice i got her away but not before he d thrown her down and given her a bloody face we ought to tell old yagorsha hey \" muckluck chuckled the boy turned on her angrily and saw her staring back at joe s ighloo there sauntering calmly past the abhorred trap was the story teller s daughter past it no she actually halted and busied herself with her legging thong that girl must be an imbecile or was it the apparition of her father up at the kachime entrance that inspired such temerity the boy had gone a few paces towards her and then turned \"yagorsha \" he called up the slope yagorsha stood stock still although the boy waved unmistakable danger signals towards joe s ighloo suddenly an arm flashed out of the tunnel caught anna by the ankle and in a twinkling she lay sprawling on her back two hands shot out seized her by the heels and dragged the wretched girl into the brute s lair it was all over in a flash a moment s paralysis of astonishment and the involuntary rush forward was arrested by muckluck who fastened herself on to the rescuer s parki tail and refused to be detached \"yagorsha \" shouted the boy but it was only the colonel who hastened towards them at the summons the poor girl s own father stood calmly smoking up there by the kachime one foot propped comfortably on the travellers loaded sled \"yagorsha \" he shouted again and then with a jerk to free himself from muckluck the boy turned sharply towards the ighloo seeming in a bewildered way to be himself about to transact this paternal business for the cowardly old loafer but muckluck clung to his arm laughing yagorsha know joe give him nice mitts sealskin new mitts hear that colonel for a pair of mitts he sells his daughter to that ruffian without definite plan quite vaguely and instinctively he shook himself free from muckluck and rushed down to the scene of the tragedy muffled screams and yells issued with the smoke muckluck turned sharply to the colonel who was following and said something that sent him headlong after the boy he seized the doughty champion by the feet just as he was disappearing in the tunnel and hauled him out what in thunder all right you go first then quick as more screams rent the still air don t be a fool you ve been interruptin the weddin ceremonies \" muckluck had caught up with them and yagorsha was advancing leisurely across the snow she no want you whispered muckluck to the boy \"she like joe like him best of all \" then as the boy gaped incredulously \"she tell me heap long time ago she want joe \" that s just part of the weddin festivity says the colonel as renewed shrieks issued from under the snow \"you ve been an officious interferer and i think the sooner i get you out o pymeut the healthier it ll be for you \" the boy was too flabbergasted to reply but he was far from convinced the colonel turned back to apologise to yagorsha no like this in your country inquired muckluck of the crestfallen champion n no not exactly when you like girl what you do tell her so muttered the boy mechanically well joe been tellin anna all winter and she hated him no she like joe best of any what did she go on like that for then oh h she know joe savvy the boy felt painfully small at his own lack of savoir but no less angry when you marry he turned to her incredulously \"will it be\" again the shrieks \"like this \" i no marry pymeut glancing riverwards he saw the dirty imp who had been so wildly entertained by the encounter on the ice still huddled on his drift wood observatory presenting as little surface to the cold as possible but grinning still with rapture at the spirited last act of the winter long drama as the boy with an exclamation of \"well i give it up walked slowly across the slope after the colonel and yagorsha muckluck lingered at his side in your country when girl marry she no scream \" well no not usually i believe she go quiet like like she want muckluck stood still with astonishment and outraged modesty they agree he answered irritably \"they don t go on like wild beasts \" muckluck pondered deeply this matter of supreme importance when you get you squaw you no make her come the boy shook his head and turned away to cut short these excursions into comparative ethnology but muckluck was athirst for the strange new knowledge what you do he declined to betray his plan of action when you all same joe hey still no answer when you know girl like you best you no drag her home no be quiet \"no how you marry you self then \" the conversation would be still more embarrassing before the colonel so he stopped and said shortly \"in our country nobody beats a woman because he likes her \" how she know then they agree i tell you oh an girl just come when he call oh h she dropped her jaw and stared \"no fight a little \" she gasped \"no scream quite small \" \"no i tell you \" he ran on and joined the colonel muckluck stood several moments rooted in amazement yagorsha had called the rest of the pymeuts out for these queer guests of theirs were evidently going at last they all said \"goo bye\" with great goodwill only muckluck in her chilly \"holy cross clo es\" stood sorrowful and silent swinging her medal slowly back and forth nicholas warned them that the pymeut air hole was not the only one no yagorsha called down the slope \"better no play tricks with him \" he nodded towards the river as the travellers looked back \"him no like him got heap plenty mouths chew you up \" and all pymeut chuckled delighted at their story teller s wit suddenly muckluck broke away from the group and ran briskly down to the river trail i will pray for you hard she caught hold of the boy s hand and shook it warmly \"sister winifred says the good father \" fact is muckluck answered the boy disengaging himself with embarrassment \"my pardner here can hold up that end don t you think you d better square yukon inua don t b lieve he likes me \" and they left her shivering in her \"holy cross clo es staring after them and sadly swinging her medal on its walrus string i don t mind sayin i m glad to leave pymeut behind said the colonel same here \" you re safe to get into a muss if you mix up with anything that has to do with women that muckluck o yours is a minx she ain t my muckluck and i don t believe she s a minx not a little bit not wishing to be too hard on his pardner the colonel added i lay it all to the chaparejos myself then observing his friend s marked absence of hilarity \"you re very gay in your fine fringes \" been a little too gay the last two or three hours well now i m glad to hear you say that i think myself we ve had adventures enough right here at the start i b lieve you but there s something in that idea o yours other fellas have noticed the same tendency in chaparejos well if the worst comes to the worst drawled the colonel \"we ll change breeches \" the suggestion roused no enthusiasm b lieve i d have a cammin influence yes sir i reckon i could keep those fringes out o kinks oh i think they ll go straight enough after this and the boy s good spirits returned before they passed the summer village it came on to snow again about six o clock that second day out and continued steadily all the night what did it matter they were used to snow and they were as jolly as clams at high tide the colonel called a halt in the shelter of a frozen slough between two banks sparsely timbered but promising all the wood they needed old as well as new he made his camp fire on the snow and the boy soon had the beef tea ready always the first course so long as liebig lasted thereafter while the bacon was frying and the tea brewing the colonel stuck up in the snow behind the fire some sticks on which to dry their foot gear when he pulled off his mucklucks his stockinged feet smoked in the frosty air the hint was all that was needed that first night on the trail for the boy to follow suit and make the change into dry things the smoky background was presently ornamented with german socks and arctic socks a kind of felt slipper and mucklucks each with a stick run through them to the toe all neatly planted in a row like monstrous products of a snow garden with dry feet burning faces and chilly backs they hugged the fire ate supper laughed and talked and said that life on the trail wasn t half bad afterwards they rolled themselves in their blankets and went to sleep on their spruce bough spring mattresses spread near the fire on the snow after about half an hour of oblivion the boy started up with the drowsy impression that a flying spark from the dying fire had set their stuff ablaze no but surely the fire had been made up again and he rubbed the sleep out of his incredulous eyes yes muckluck was standing there what in thunder he began \"wh what is it \" it is me i can see that much but what brings you here shivering with cold she crouched close to the fire dressed as he could see now in her native clothes again and it was her parki that had scorched was scorching still me i smiling she drew a stiff hand out of its mitten and held it over the reviving blaze glancing towards the colonel he seemed to be sleeping very sound powdered over already with soft wet snow but she whispered her next remark i think i come help you find that onge grove i think you ll do nothing of the kind he also spoke with a deliberate lowering of the note his great desire not to wake the colonel gave an unintentional softness to his tone you think winter bad time for squaws to travel she shook her head and showed her beautiful teeth an instant in the faint light then rising half shy but very firm \"i no wait till summer \" he was so appalled for the moment at the thought of having her on their hands all this way from pymeut on a snowy night that words failed him as she watched him she too grew grave you say me nice girl when did i say that he clutched his head in despair when you first come when sham n make ol chief all well i don t remember it yes i think you misunderstood me muckluck heh her countenance fell but more puzzled than wounded that is oh yes of course you re a nice girl i think anna too you like me best she helped out the white man s bashfulness but as her interlocutor appalled laid no claim to the sentiment she lifted the mittened hand to her eyes and from under it scanned the white face through the lightly falling snow the other hand still held out to the comfort of the smoke was trembling a little perhaps not altogether with the cold the colonel ll have to take over the breeches said the boy with the air of one wandering in his head then desperately \"what am i to do what am i to say \" say you say you no like girl scream no like her fight like anna heh so me i come like your girls quite quite good heh you don t understand muckluck i you see i could never find that orange grove if you came along why well a no woman ever goes to help to find an orange grove th there s a law against it heh law alas she knew too little to be impressed by the majesty invoked you see women they they come by and by when the orange grove s all all ready for em no man ever takes a woman on that kind of hunt her saddened face was very grave the boy took heart now the pymeuts are going in a week or two nicholas said to hunt caribou in the hills yes but they won t take you to hunt caribou no they leave you at home it s exactly the same with orange groves no nice girl ever goes hunting her lip trembled me i can fish course you can his spirits were reviving \"you can do anything except hunt \" as she lifted her head with an air of sudden protest he quashed her \"from the beginning there s been a law against that squaws must stay at home and let the men do the huntin \" me i can cook she was crying now \"while you hunt good supper all ready when you come home \" he shook his head solemnly perhaps you don t know she flashed a moment s hope through her tears \"me learn sew up at holy cross sew up your socks for you when they open their mouths \" but she could see that not even this grand new accomplishment availed can help pull sled she suggested looking round a little wildly as if instantly to illustrate \"never tired she added sobbing and putting her hands up to her face sh sh don t wake the colonel \" he got up hastily and stood beside her at the smouldering fire he patted her on the shoulder \"of course you re a nice girl the nicest girl in the yukon\" he caught himself up as she dropped her hands from her face \"that is you will be if you go home quietly \" again she hid her eyes go home how could he send her home all that way at this time of night it was a bothering business again her hands fell from the wet unhappy face she shivered a little when she met his frowning looks and turned away he stooped and picked up her mitten why you couldn t turn a dog away on a night like this plague take the pymeuts root and branch she had shuffled her feet into her snow shoe straps and moved off in the dimness but for the sound of sobbing he could not have told just where in the softly falling snow muckluck s figure was fading into the dusk he hurried after her conscience stricken but most unwilling look here he said when he had caught up with her \"i m sorry you came all this way in the cold very sorry \" her sobs burst out afresh and louder now away from the colonel s restraining presence \"but see here i can t send you off like this you might die on the trail \" yes i think me die she agreed no don t do that come back and we ll tell the colonel you re going to stay by the fire till morning and then go home she walked steadily on \"no i go now \" but you can t muckluck you can t find the trail i tell you before i not like your girls i can go in winter as good as summer i can hunt she turned on him fiercely \"once i hunt a owel ketch him too \" she sniffed back her tears \"i can do all kinds \" no you can t hunt orange groves he said with a severity that might seem excessive \"but i can t let you go off in this snowstorm \" he soon stop goo bye never word of sweeter import in his ears than that but he was far from satisfied with his conduct all the same it was quite possible that the pymeuts discovering her absence would think he had lured her away and there might be complications so it was with small fervour that he said \"muckluck i wish you d come back and wait till morning \" no i go now she was in the act of darting forward on those snow shoes that she used so skillfully when some sudden thought cried halt she even stopped crying \"i no like go near blow hole by night i keep to trail \" but how the devil do you do it she paid no heed to the interruption seeming busy in taking something over her head from round her neck to morrow she said lowering her tear harshened voice \"you find blow hole you give this to yukon inua say i send it he will not hate you any more \" she burst into a fresh flood of tears in a moment the dim sight of her the faint trail of crying left in her wake had so wholly vanished that but for the bit of string as it seemed to be left in his half frozen hands he could almost have convinced himself he had dreamt the unwelcome visit the half shut eye of the camp fire gleamed cheerfully as he ran back and crouched down where poor little muckluck had knelt so sure of a welcome muckluck cogitated the boy will believe more firmly than ever that if a man doesn t beat a girl he doesn t mean business what was it he had wound round one hand what was it dangling in the acrid smoke that then her trinket the crowning ornament of her holy cross holiday attire that was what she was offering the old ogre of the yukon for his unworthy sake he stirred up the dying fire to see it better a woman s face some catholic saint he held the medal lower to catch the fitful blaze \" d g autocratrix russorum \" the great katharine only a little crown on her high rolled hair and her splendid chest all uncovered to the arctic cold her yukon subjects must have wondered that she wore no parki this lady who had claimed sole right to all the finest sables found in her new american dominions on the other side of the medal minerva with a gorgon furnished shield and a beautiful bone tipped harpoon as it looked with a throwing stick and all complete but she too would strike the yukon eye as lamentably chilly about the legs how had these ladies out of russia and olympus come to lodge in ol chief s ighloo had glovotsky won this guerdon at great katharine s hands had he brought it on that last long journey of his to russian america and left it to his pymeut children with his bones well yukon inua should not have it yet the boy thrust the medal into a pocket of his chaparejos and crawled into his snow covered bed chapter xi holy cross raise the stone and ye shall find me cleave the wood and there am i the stars were shining frostily in a clear sky when the boy crawled out from under his snow drift in the morning he built up the fire quaking in the bitter air and bustled the breakfast you seem to be in something of a hurry said the colonel with a yawn stifled in a shiver we haven t come on this trip to lie abed in the morning his pardner returned with some solemnity \"i don t care how soon i begin caperin ahead with that load again \" well it ll be warmin anyway returned the colonel \"and i can t say as much for your fire \" it was luck that the first forty miles of the trail had already been traversed by the boy he kept recognising this and that in the landscape with an effect of good cheer on both of them it postponed a little the realization of their daring in launching themselves upon the arctic waste without a guide or even a map that was of the smallest use half an hour after setting off they struck into the portage even with a snow blurred trail the boy s vivid remembrance of the other journey gave them the sustaining sense that they were going right the colonel was working off the surprising stiffness with which he had wakened and they were both warm now but the colonel s footsoreness was considerable an affliction besides bound to be worse before it was better the boy spoke with the old timer s superiority of his own experience and was so puffed up at the bare thought of having hardened his feet that he concealed without a qualm the fact of a brand new blister on his heel a mere nothing that not worth mentioning to anyone who remembered the state he was in at the end of that awful journey of penitence it was well on in the afternoon before it began to snow again and they had reached the frozen lake the days were lengthening and they still had good light by which to find the well beaten trail on the other side now in a minute we ll hear the mission dogs what did i tell you out of the little wood a couple of teams were coming at a good round pace they were pulled up at the waterhole and the mission natives ran on to meet the new arrivals they recognised the boy and insisted on making the colonel who was walking very lame ride to the mission in the strongest sled and they took turns helping the dogs by pushing from behind the snow was falling heavily again and one of the indians henry looking up with squinted eyes said \"there ll be nothing left of that walrus tusk \" hey inquired the boy straining at his sled rope and bending before the blast \"what s that \" don t you know what makes snow said henry no what does ivory whittlings when they get to their carving up yonder then we have snow what was happening to the colonel the mere physical comfort of riding instead of serving as packhorse great as it was not even that could so instantly spirit away the weariness and light up the curious solemn radiance that shone on the colonel s face it struck the boy that good old kentucky would look like that when he met his dearest at the gate of heaven if there was such a place the colonel was aware of the sidelong wonder of his comrade s glance for the sleds abreast had come to a momentary halt but still he stared in front of him just as a sailor in a storm dares not look away from the beacon light an instant knowing all the waste about him abounds in rocks and eddies and in death and all the world of hope and safe returning is narrowed to that little point of light after the moment s speculation the boy turned his eyes to follow the colonel s gaze into space the cross the cross said the man on the sled \"don t you see it \" oh that yes at the boy s tone the colonel for the first time turned his eyes away from the great white symbol don t know what you re made of if seeing that you needn t be a church member but only a man i should think to to he blew out his breath in impotent clouds and then went on \"we americans think a good deal o the stars and stripes but that up yonder that s the mightier symbol \" huh says the boy \"stars and stripes tell of an ideal of united states that up there tells of an ideal of united mankind it s the great brotherhood mark there isn t any other standard that men would follow just to build a hospice in a place like this \" at an upper window in a building on the far side of the white symbol the travellers caught a glimpse through the slanting snow of one of the sisters of st ann shutting in the bright light with thick curtains \"glass \" ejaculated the colonel one of the indians had run on to announce them and as they drew up at the door that the boy remembered as a frame for brother paul with his lamp to search out iniquity and his face of denunciation out came father brachet brisk almost running his two hands outstretched his face a network of welcoming wrinkles no long waiting this time in the reception room straight upstairs to hot baths and mild reviving drinks and then refreshed and already rested down to supper with a shade of anxiety the boy looked about for brother paul but father wills was here anyhow and the boy greeted him joyfully as a tried friend and a man to be depended on there was brother etienne and there were two strange faces father brachet put the colonel on his right and the boy on his left introducing \"fazzer richmond my predecessor as ze head of all ze alaskan missions calmly eliminating greek episcopalian and other heretic establishments fazzer richmond you must have heard much of he is ze great ausority up here he is now ze travelling priest you can ask him all he knows everysing \" in no wise abashed by this flourish father richmond shook hands with the big chimney men smiling and with a pleasant ease that communicated itself to the entire company it was instantly manifest that the scene of this jesuit s labours had not been chiefly or long beyond the borders of civilization in the plain bare room where for all its hospitality and good cheer reigned an air of rude simplicity and austerity of life into this somewhat rarefied atmosphere father richmond brought a whiff from another world as he greeted the two strangers and said simply that he had just arrived himself by way of the anvik portage the colonel felt that he must have meant from new york or from paris instead of the words he added \"from st michael s \" he claimed instant kinship with the colonel on the strength of their both being southerners i m a baltimore man he said with an accent no marylander can purge of pride how long since you ve been home oh i go back every year he goes all over ze world to tell ze people something of the work being done here by father brachet and all of them he included the other priests and lay brothers in a slight circular movement of the grizzled head and to collect funds the colonel rightly divined little guessing how triumphantly he achieved that end alaska is so remote said the travelling priest as if in apology for popular ignorance \"and people think of it so inadequately shall we say in trying to explain the conditions up here i have my chief difficulty in making them realise the great distances we have to cover you tell them that in the indian tongue alaska means \"the great country they smile and think condescendingly of savage imagery it is vain to say we have an area of six hundred thousand square miles we talk much in these days of education but few men and no women can count our eastern friends get some idea of what we mean when we tell them alaska is bigger than all the atlantic states from maine to louisiana with half of great texas thrown in with a coast line of twenty six thousand miles this alaska of ours turns to the sea a greater frontage than all the shores of all the united states combined it extends so far out towards asia that it carries the dominions of the great republic as far west of san francisco as new york is east of it making california a central state i try to give europeans some idea of it by saying that if you add england ireland and scotland together and to that add france and to that add italy you still lack enough to make a country the size of alaska i do not speak of our mountains seventeen eighteen nineteen thousand feet high and our yukon flowing for more than two thousand miles through a country almost virgin still you travel about up here a good deal he travels all ze time he will not rest said father brachet as one airing an ancient grievance yes i will rest now a little i have been eight hundred miles over the ice with dogs since january the boy looked at him with something very like reverence here was a man who could give you tips you have travelled abroad too the colonel rather stated than asked i spent a good deal of my youth in france and germany educated over there well i am a johns hopkins man but i may say i found my education in rome speaking of education he turned to the other priests \"i have greatly advanced my grammar since we parted \" father brachet answered with animation in french and the conversation went forward for some minutes in that tongue the discussion was interrupted to introduce the other new face at the bottom of the table to the big chimney men resident fazzer roget of ze kuskoquim mission that is the best man on snow shoes in central alaska said father richmond low to the colonel nodding at the kuskoquim priest and he knows more of two of ze native dialects here zan anyone else added the father superior you must forgive our speaking much of the indian tongues said father richmond \"we are all making dictionaries and grammars we have still to translate much of our religious instruction and the great variety in dialect of the scattered tribes keeps us busy with linguistic studies \" tomorrow you must see our schools said father brachet but the boy answered quickly that they could not afford the time he was surprised at the colonel s silence but the boy didn t know what the colonel s feet felt like kentucky ain t sorry he said to himself to have a back to his chair and to eat off china again kentucky s a voluptuary i ll have to drag him away by main force and the boy allowed father richmond to help him yet more abundantly to the potatoes and cabbage grown last summer in the mission garden it was especially the vegetables that lent an element of luxury to the simple meal the warm room the excellent food better cooked than any they had had for seven months produced a gentle somnolence the thought of the inviting look of the white covered bed upstairs lay like a balm on the spirits of men not born to roughing it as the travellers said an early and grateful good night the boy added sleepily something about the start at dawn father brachet answered \"morning will bring counsel my son i sink ze bleezzar r will not let us lose you so soon \" they overslept themselves and they knew it in that way the would be early riser does before ever he looks into the accusing face of his watch the boy leapt out of bed hear that the wind was booming among the settlement buildings sounds as if there was weather outside a glance between the curtains showed the great gale at its height the snow blew level in sheets and darkened the air well said the colonel splashing mightily in the ice cold water \"i don t know as i mind giving my feet twenty four hours time to come to their senses \" a hurried toilet and they went downstairs sharp set for breakfast after the long refreshing sleep father richmond was writing on his knee by the stove in the reception room good morning good morning he rang the bell well what did we tell you i don t think you ll get far today let these gentlemen know when breakfast is ready he said as christopher put his head in he looked at his watch \"i hope you will find everything you need he said and continuing to talk about the gale and some damage it had done to one of the outbuildings he went into the entry just beyond the reception room door and began to put on his furs you are not going out in such weather \" the colonel called after him incredulously only as far as the church oh is there church today inquired the boy more cheerfully than one might expect the colonel started and made a signal for discretion blest if it isn t sunday he said under his breath he doesn t seem dead set on our observing it whispered the boy the colonel warmed himself luxuriously at the stove and seemed to listen for that summons from the entry that never came was father richmond out there still or had he gone do they think we are heathens because we are not jesuits he said under his breath suddenly throwing out his great chest perhaps we ought to hey they ve been awfully considerate of us the colonel went to the door father richmond was struggling with his snow boots with your permission sir says the colonel in his most magnificent manner \"we will accompany you or follow if you are in haste \" with all my heart come said the priest \"if you will wait and breakfast with us after mass \" it was agreed and the immediate order was countermanded the sound of a bell came muffled through the storm with thoughts turning reluctantly from breakfast \"what s that \" asked the boy that is our church bell the father had helped the colonel to find his parki oh a of course a fine tone don t you think but you can t tell so well in this storm we are fond of our bell it is the first that ever rang out in the yukon valley listen they stood still a moment before opening the front door the boy seeing the very look of a certain high shouldered gray stone \"st andrew s\" far away and himself trotting along beside that figure inseparable from first memories was dimly aware again as he stood at the jesuit s door in these different days of the old sunday feeling invading permeating his consciousness half reluctant half amused the colonel sat in a rural church and looked at the averted face of a woman only to the priest was the sound all music that language he said \"speaks to men whatever tongue they call their own the natives hear it for miles up the river and down the river and over the white hills and far across the tundra they come many miles to mass \" he opened the door and the gale rushed in i do not mean on days like this he wound up smiling and out they went into the whirling snow the church was a building of logs like the others except that it was of one story father brachet was already there with father wills and brother etienne and after a moment in came brother paul looking more waxen and aloof than ever at the head of the school the rear brought up by brother vincent and henry in a moment the little mother superior appeared followed by two nuns heading a procession of native women and girls they took their places on the other side of the church and bowed their heads beautiful creature ejaculated the colonel under his breath glancing back his companion turned his head sharply just in time to see sister winifred come last into the church holding by either hand a little child both men watched her as she knelt down between the children s sallow screwed up squinting little visages the calm unconscious face of the nun shone white like a flower the strangers glanced discreetly about the rude little church with its pictures and its modest attempt at stained glass no wonder all this impresses the ignorant native whispered the colonel catching himself up suddenly from sharing in that weakness without the wild march storm swept the white world within another climate reigned something of summer and the far off south of italy herself transplanted to this little island of civilisation anchored in the northern waste s pose you ve seen all the big cathedrals eh good many there was still a subdued rustling in the church and outside still the clanging bell contended with the storm and this makes you smile n no returned the older man with a kind of reluctance \"i ve seen many a worse church america s full of em \" hey so far as dignity goes the colonel was wrestling with some vague impression difficult for him to formulate \"you see you can t build anything with wood that s better than a log cabin for looks just looks it beats all your fancy gimcracks even brick beats everything else hollow except stone then they ve got candles we went on last night about the luxury of oil lamps they don t bring em in here \" we do in our prairie and southern country churches i know but look at those altar lights the boy was too busy looking at sister winifred \"i tell you sir a man never made a finer thing than a tall wax candle \" sh mustn t talk in church the colonel stared a moment at the boy s presumption drew himself up a little pompously and crossed his arms over his huge chest why they ve got an organ the boy forgot his strict views on church etiquette as the sudden sweetness swelled in the air brother paul with head thrown back and white face lifted was playing slowly absently like one who listens to some great choir invisible and keeps their time with a few obedient but unnecessary chords and yet the fella can play the colonel admitted the native choir composed entirely of little dark faced boys sang their way truly through the service father brachet celebrating mass brother paul s ill isn t he look the lay brother had swayed and drooped forward over the keyboard but his choir sang steadily on he recovered himself and beckoned one of the boys to his side when he rose the child nodded and took the organist s place playing quite creditably to the end brother paul sat in the corner with bowed head coming out they were in time to confront sister winifred holding back the youngest children eager to anticipate their proper places in the procession the boy looked fixedly at her wondering suddenly meeting the clear eyes he smiled and then shrank inwardly at his forwardness he could not tell if she remembered him the colonel finding himself next her at the door bowed and stood back for her to pass no she said gently \"my little children must wait for the older ones \" you have them under good discipline madam he laid his hand on the furry shoulder of the smallest the boy stood behind the colonel unaccountably shy in the presence of the only white woman he had seen in nearly seven months she couldn t be any older than he and yet she was a nun what a gulf opened at the word sister winifred and her charges fell into rank at the tail of the little procession and vanished in the falling snow at breakfast the colonel would not sit down till he was presented to brother paul sir he said in his florid but entirely sincere fashion \"i should like to thank you for the pleasure of hearing that music to day we were much impressed sir by the singing how old is the boy who played the organ \" ten said brother paul and for the first time the boy saw him smile yes i think he has music in him our little jerome and how well all your choir has the service by heart their unison is perfect yes said father brachet from the head of the table \"our music has never been so good as since paul came among us \" he lifted his hand and every one bowed his head after grace father richmond took the floor conversationally as seemed to be his wont and breakfast went on as supper had the night before to the accompaniment of his shrewd observations and lively anecdotes in the midst of all the laughter and good cheer brother paul sat at the end of the board eating absently saying nothing and no one speaking to him father richmond especially but indeed all of them seemed arrant worldlings beside the youngest of the lay brethren the colonel could more easily imagine father richmond walking the streets of paris or of rome than \"hitting the yukon trail \" he marvelled afresh at the devotion that brought such a man to wear out his fine attainments his scholarship his energy his wide and catholic knowledge in travelling winter after winter hundreds of miles over the ice from one indian village to another you could not divorce father richmond in your mind from the larger world outside he spoke with its accent he looked with his humourous experienced eyes you found it natural to think of him in very human relations you wondered about his people and what brought him to this not so with brother paul he was one of those who suggest no country upon any printed map you have to be reminded that you do not know his birthplace or his history it was this same brother paul who after breakfast and despite the pymeut incident offered to show the gold seekers over the school the big recitation room was full of natives and decidedly stuffy they did not stay long upstairs \"i sleep here in the dormitory said the brother and i live with the pupils as much as i can i often eat with them he added as one who mounts a climax they have to be taught everything and they have to be taught it over again every day \" except music apparently except music and games brother vincent teaches them football and baseball and plays with them and works with them part of each day is devoted to manual training and to sport he led the way to the workshop one of our brothers is a carpenter and master mechanic he called to a pupil passing the door and told him the strangers would like to inspect the school work very proudly the lad obeyed he himself was a carpenter and showed his half finished table the boy s eye fell on a sled yes said the lad \"that kind better your kind no good \" he had evidently made intimate acquaintance with the boy s masterpiece yours is splendid admitted the unskilled workman will you sell it the colonel asked brother paul they make them to sell was the answer and the transaction was soon effected it has stopped snowing and ze wind is fallen said father brachet going to the reception room window an hour or so after they had come in from dinner the colonel exchanged looks with the boy and drew out his watch later than i thought much the colonel agreed and sat considering watch in hand i sink our friends must see now ze girls school and ze laundry hein to be sure agreed father richmond \"i will take you over and give you into the hands of our mother superior \" why it s much warmer said the boy as they went by the cross and father richmond greeted the half dozen native boys who were packing down the fresh snow under their broad shoes laughing and shouting to one another as they made anew the familiar mission trails the door of the two story house on the opposite side of the settlement was opened by sister winifred friends of ours from the white camp below she acknowledged the nameless introduction smiling but at the request that followed \"ah it is too bad that just to day the mother superior she is too faint and weak to go about will you see her father \" yes if you will show these strangers the school and laundry and oh yes i will show them she led the way into the cheerful schoolroom where big girls and little girls were sitting about amusing themselves in the quiet of a long sunday afternoon several of the younger children ran to her as she came in and stood holding fast to the folds of her black habit staring up at the strangers while she explained the kind of instruction given the system and the order reigning in each department finally she persuaded a little girl only six years old to take her dusky face out of the long flowing veil of the nun and show how quickly she could read a sentence that sister winifred wrote on the blackboard then others were called on and gave examples of their accomplishments in easy arithmetic and spelling the children must have been very much bored with themselves that stormy sunday for they entered into the examination with a quite unnatural zest two of the elder girls recited and some specimens of penmanship and composition were shown the delicate complexion of the little nun flushed to a pretty wild rose pink as these pupils of hers won the colonel s old fashioned compliments and they are taught most particularly of all she hastened to say cooking housekeeping and sewing whereupon specimens of needlework were brought out and cast like pearls before the swine s eyes of the ignorant men but they were impressed in their benighted way and said so and we teach them laundry work she led the way with the children trooping after to the washhouse \"no run back you ll take cold run back and you shall sing for the strangers before they go \" she smiled them away a happy faced clean little throng striking contrast to the neglected filthy children seen in the native villages as they were going into the laundry father richmond came out of the house and stopped to point out to the colonel a snow covered enclosure \"the sisters garden\" and he told how marvellously in the brief summer some of the hardier vegetables flourished there they spring up like magic at the edge of the snow drifts and they do not rest from their growing all night if the time is short they have twice as much sunlight as with you they drink it in the whole summer night as well as all the day and over here is the fathers garden talking still he led the way towards a larger enclosure on the other side of the cross sister winifred paused a moment and then as they did not turn back and the boy stood waiting she took him into the drying room and into the ironing room and then returned to the betubbed apartment first invaded there was only one blot on the fairness of that model laundry a heap of torn and dirty canvas in the middle of the floor the boy vaguely thought it looked familiar before the sister blushing faintly said \"we hope you won t go before we have time to repair it \" why it s our old sled cover yes it is very much cut and torn but you do not go at once yes to morrow oh father brachet thought you would stay for a few days at least we have no time you go like the rest for gold like the rest but you came before to help poor nicholas out of his trouble he was quite able to help himself as it turned out why will you go so far and at such risk she said with a suddenness that startled them both i i well i think i go chiefly because i want to get my home back i lost my home when i was a little chap where is your home here how long have you been here nearly two years then how can you call it home i do that only that i may speak your language of course it is not my real home where is the real home i hope it is in heaven she said with a simplicity that took away all taint of cant or mere phrase making but where do you come from i come from montreal oh and don t you ever go back to visit your people no i never go back but you will some time no i shall never go back don t you want to she dropped her eyes but very steadfastly she said my work is here but you are young and you may live a great great many years she nodded and looked out of the open door the colonel and the travelling priest were walking in indian file the new made hard packed path yes she said in a level voice \"i shall grow old here and here i shall be buried \" i shall never understand it i have such a longing for my home i came here ready to bear anything that i might be able to get it back she looked at him steadily and gravely i may be wrong but i doubt if you would be satisfied even if you got it back now what makes you think that he said sharply because and she checked herself as if on the verge of something too personal \"you can never get back a thing you ve lost when the old thing is there again you are not as you were when you lost it and the change in you makes the old thing new and strange \" oh it s plain i am very different from you but he said it with a kind of uneasy defiance \"besides in any case i shall do it for my sister s sake \" oh you have a sister he nodded how long since you left her it s a good while now perhaps your sister won t want that particular home any more than you when you two meet again then seeming not to notice the shade on her companion s face \"i promised my children they should sing for you do you mind will your friend come in too \" and looking from the door after the colonel and the father as they turned to rejoin them \"he is odd that big friend of yours she said quite like a human being as the boy thought instantly he s not odd i assure you \" he called me madam she spoke with a charming piqued childishness you see he didn t know your name what is your name sister winifred but your real name he said with the american s insistence on his own point of view that is my only name she answered with dignity and led the way back into the schoolroom another older nun was there and when the others rejoined them they made the girls sing now we have shown you enough said father richmond rising \"boasted to you enough of the very little we are able to accomplish here we must save something for to morrow \" ah to morrow we take to the trail again said the colonel and added his \"good bye madam \" sister winifred seeing he expected it gave him her hand good bye and thank you for coming for your poor he said shyly as he turned away and left a gift in her palm thank you for showing us all this the boy said lingering but not daring to shake hands \"it it seems very wonderful i had no idea a mission meant all this \" oh it means more more than anything you can see good bye good bye in the early evening the reception room was invaded by the lads school for their usual sunday night entertainment very proudly these boys and young men sang their glees and choruses played the fiddle recited even danced pity mac isn t here awful pity sunday too brother etienne sang some french military songs and it came out that he had served in the french army father roget sang also in french explaining himself with a humourous skill in pantomime that set the room in a roar well said the colonel when he stood up to say good night \"i haven t enjoyed an evening so much for years \" it is very early still said father brachet wrinkling up his face in a smile ah but we have to make such an early start the colonel went up to bed leaving the boy to go to father richmond s room to look at his grammar of the indian language the instant the door was shut the priest set down the lamp and laid his hands on the young man s shoulders my son you must not go on this mad journey i must you know you must not sit there he pushed him into a chair \"let me tell you i do not speak as the ignorant i have in my day travelled many hundreds of miles on the ice but i ve done it in the season when the trail s at its best with dogs my son and with tried native servants \" i know it is pleasanter that way but pleasanter it is the way to keep alive but the indians travel with hand sleds for short distances yes and they are inured to the climate you you know nothing of what lies before you but we ll find out as other people have the boy smiled confidently i assure you my son it is madness this thing you are trying to do the chances of either of you coming out alive are one in fifty in fifty did i say in five hundred i don t think so father we don t mean to travel when but you ll have to travel to stay in such places as you ll find yourself in will be to starve or if by any miracle you escape the worst effects of cold and hunger you ll get caught in the ice in the spring break up and go down to destruction on a floe you ve no conception what it s like if you were six weeks earlier or six weeks later i would hold my peace the boy looked at the priest and then away was it going to be so bad would they leave their bones on the ice would they go washing by the mission in the great spring flood that all men spoke of with the same grave look he had a sudden vision of the torrent as it would be in june among the whirling ice masses that swept by two bodies swollen unrecognisable one gigantic one dressed gaily in chaparejos and neither would lift his head but like men bent grimly upon some great errand they would hurry on past the tall white cross with never a sign on on to the sea be persuaded my son dimly the boy knew he was even now borne along upon a current equally irresistible this one setting northward as that other back to the south he found himself shaking his head under the jesuit s remonstrant eyes we ve lost so much time already we couldn t possibly turn back now then here s my grammar with an almost comic change of tone and manner the priest turned to the table where the lamp stood among piles of neatly tied up and docketed papers he undid one of the packets with an ear on the sudden sounds outside in the passage brother paul s got it in the schoolhouse brother paul he hadn t been at the entertainment and no one seemed to have missed him how did sister winifred know asked another voice old maria told her father richmond got up and opened the door what is it it s a new born indian baby the father looked down as if it might be on the threshold \"brother paul found it below at the village all done up ready to be abandoned \" tell sister winifred i ll see about it in the morning she says pardon me father she says that is like a man if i do not bring the little indian in twenty minutes she will come herself and get it father richmond laughed good night my son and he went downstairs with the others colonel you asleep the boy asked softly no he struggled in silence with his mucklucks presently \"isn t it frightfully strange he mused aloud doesn t it pull a fella up by the roots somehow to see americans on this old track \" the colonel had the bedclothes drawn up to his eyes under the white quilt he made some undistinguishable sound but he kept his eyes fastened on his pardner everything that we americans have done everything that we are is achieved by the grace of goin bang the other way the boy pulled off a muckluck and threw it half across the room \"and yet and yet \" he sat with one stocking foot in his hand and stared at the candle i wonder colonel if it satisfies anybody to be a hustler and a millionaire satisfies echoed the colonel pushing his chin over the bed clothes who expects to be satisfied why every man woman and child on the top o the earth and it just strikes me i ve never personally known anybody get there but these fellas at holy cross the colonel pushed back the bedclothes a little farther with his chin haven t you got the gumption to see why it is this place and these men take such a hold on you it s because you ve eaten slept and lived for half a year in a space the size of this bedroom we ve got so used to narrowing life down that the first result of a little larger outlook is to make us dizzy now you hurry up and get to bed you ll sleep it off the boy woke at four o clock and after the match light by which he consulted his watch had flickered out he lay a long time staring at the dark silence still reigned supreme when at last he got up washed and dressed and went downstairs an irresistible restlessness had seized hold of him he pulled on his furs cautiously opened the door and went out down over the crisp new crust to the river and back in the dimness past the fathers house to the settlement behind then to the right towards the hillside as he stumbled up the slope he came to a little burial ground half hidden in the snow white wooden crosses marked the graves \"and here i shall be buried she had said here \" he came down the hill and round by the sisters house that window that was where a light had shone the evening they arrived and a nun sister winifred had stood drawing the thick curtains shutting out the world he thought in the intense stillness that he heard sounds from that upper room yes surely an infant s cry a curious heavy hearted feeling came upon him as he turned away and went slowly back towards the other house he halted a moment under the cross and stared up at it the door of the fathers house opened and the travelling priest stood on the threshold the boy went over to him nodding good morning so you are all ready eager to go from us no but you see i see he held the door open and the boy went in i don t believe the colonel s awake yet he said as he took off his furs \"i ll just run up and rouse him \" it is very early the priest laid his hand on the young man s arm \"and he will not sleep so well for many a night to come it is an hour till breakfast \" henry had lit the fire and now left it roaring the priest took a chair and pushed one forward for his guest the boy sat down stretched his legs out straight towards the fire and lifting his hands clasped them behind his head the priest read the homesick face like a book why are you up here before there was time for reply he added surely a young man like you could find nearer home many a gate ajar and you must have had glimpses through of things many and fair oh yes i ve had glimpses of those things well what i wanted most i never saw you wanted to be sure ah it is one of the results of agnosticism the boy never saw the smile i ve said and i was not lying that i came away to shorten the business of fortune making to buy back an old place we love my sister and i but which does she love best the old place or the young brother oh she cares about me no doubt o that he smiled the smile of faith has she an understanding heart the most i know then she would be glad to know you had found a home for the spirit a home for the body what does it matter in the pause father brachet opened the door but seemed suddenly to remember some imperative call elsewhere the boy jumped up but the superior had vanished without even \"good morning \" the boy sat down again of course he went on with that touch of pedantry so common in american youth \"the difficulty in my case is an intellectual one i think i appreciate the splendid work you do and i see as i never saw before \" he stopped you strike your foot against the same stone of stumbling over which the pharisees fell when the man whom jesus healed by the way replied to their questioning whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see i don t deny that the life here has been a revelation to me i m not talkin about creeds for i don t know much about them and i don t think it s in me to care much but so far as the work here is concerned he paused we can take little credit for that it is the outcome of our order the boy failed to catch the effect of the capital letter yes it s just that the order the good government a fella would be a bigot if he couldn t see that the system is as nearly perfect as a human institution can be that has been said before of the society of jesus but he spoke with the wise man s tolerance for the discoveries of the young still it was not to discuss the merits of his order that he had got up an hour before his time \"i understand maybe better than yourself something of the restlessness that drove you here \" you understand the priest nodded you had the excuse of the old plantation and the sister the boy sat up suddenly a little annoyed the priest kept on \"but you felt a great longing to make a breach in the high walls that shut you in you wanted to fare away on some voyage of discovery wasn t that it \" he paused now in his turn but the boy looked straight before him saying nothing the priest leaned forward with a deeper gravity it will be a fortunate expedition this my son if thou discover thyself and in time still the boy said nothing the other resumed more lightly \"in america we combine our travels with business but it is no new idea in the world that a young man should have his wanderjahr before he finds what he wants or even finds acquiescence it did not need wilhelm meister to set the feet of youth on that trail it did not need the crusades it s as old as the idea of a golden fleece or a promised land it was the first man s first inkling of heaven \" the boy pricked his ears wasn t this heresy the old idea of the strenuous to leave home and comfort and security and go out to search for wisdom or holiness or happiness whether it is gold or the san grael the instinct of search is deep planted in the race it is this that the handful of men who live in what they call the world it is this they forget every hour in the greater world outside someone somewhere is starting out upon this journey he may go only as far as germany to study philosophy or to the nearest mountain top and find there the thing he seeks or he may go to the ends of the earth and still not find it he may travel in a hindu gown or a mongolian tunic or he comes like father brachet out of his vineyards in the pleasant land of france or like you out of a country where all problems are to be solved by machinery but my point is they come when all the other armies of the world are disbanded that army my son will be still upon the march they were silent awhile and still the young face gave no sign to many the travelling priest went on \"the impulse is a blind one or a shy one shrinking from calling itself by the old names but none the less this instinct for the quest is still the gallant way of youth confronted by a sense of the homelessness they cannot think will last \" that s it father that s it the boy burst out \"homelessness to feel that is to feel something urging you \" he stopped frowning urging you to take up your staff said the priest they were silent a moment and then the same musical voice tolled out the words like a low bell \"but with all your journeying my son you will come to no continuing city \" it s no use to say this to me you see i am i ll tell you why i say it the priest laid a hand on his arm \"i see men going up and down all their lives upon this quest once in a great while i see one for whom i think the journey may be shortened \" how shortened a heavy step on the stair and the boy seemed to wake from a dream good morning said the colonel coming in cheerily rubbing his hands i am very jealous he glanced at the boy s furs on the floor \"you have been out seeing the rest of the mission without me \" no no we will show you the rest as much as you care for after breakfast i m afraid we oughtn t to delay but they did \"for a few minutes while zey are putting a little fresh meat on your sled as father brachet said they went first to see the dogs fed for they got breakfast when they were at home those pampered mission dogs and now we will show you our store house our caches \" while father brachet looked in the bunch for the key he wanted a native came by with a pail he entered the low building on the left leaving wide the door what no is it really no not really the colonel was more excited than the boy had ever seen him without the smallest ceremony he left the side of his obliging host strode to the open door and disappeared inside what on earth s the matter i cannot tell it is but our cow house they followed and looking in at the door the boy saw a picture that for many a day painted itself on his memory for inside the dim straw strewn place stood the big kentuckian with one arm round the cow talking to her and rubbing her nose while down his own a tear trickled hey well yes just my view sukey yes old girl alaska s a funny kind o place for you and me to be in isn t it hey ye e yes and he stroked the cow and sniffed back the salt water and called out seeing the boy \"look they ve got a thoroughbred bull too an a heifer lord i haven t been in any place so like home for a coon s age you go and look at the caches i ll stay here while sambo milks her \" my name is sebastian oh all right reckon you can milk her under that name too when they came back the colonel was still there exchanging views about alaska with sukey and with sebastian about the bull sister winifred came hurrying over the snow to the cow house with a little tin pail in her hand ah but you are slow sebastian she called out almost petulantly good morning she said to the others and with a quick clutch at a respectful and submissive demeanour she added half aside \"what do you think father brachet they forgot that baby because he is good and sleeps late they drink up all the milk \" ah there is very little now very little father said sebastian returning to the task from which the colonel s conversation had diverted him i put aside some last night and they used it i send you to bring me only a little drop she was by sebastian now holding out the small pail unmindful of the others who were talking stock \"and you stay and stay \" give me your can the boy took it from her and held it inside the big milk pail so that the thin stream struck it sharply there it is enough her shawl had fallen the colonel gathered it up i will carry the milk back for you said the boy noticing how red and cold the slim hands were \"your fingers will be frostbitten if you don t wrap them up \" she pulled the old shawl closely round her and set a brisk pace back to the sisters house i must go carefully or i might slip and if i spilt the milk oh you mustn t do that she paused suddenly and then went on but more slowly than before a glaze had formed on the hard trodden path and one must needs walk warily once she looked back with anxiety and seeing that the precious milk was being carried with due caution her glance went gratefully to the boy s face he felt her eyes i m being careful he laughed a little embarrassed and not at first lifting his bent head when after an instant he did so he found the beautiful calm eyes full upon him but no self consciousness there she turned away gentle and reflective and was walking on when some quick summons seemed to reach her she stopped quite still again as if seized suddenly by a detaining hand her own hands dropped straight at her sides and the rusty shawl hung free a second time she turned the boy thought to him again but as he glanced up wondering he saw that the fixed yet serene look went past him like a homing dove a neglected slighted feeling came over him she wasn t thinking of him the least in the world nor even of the milk he was at such pains to carry for her what was she staring at he turned his head over his right shoulder nothing no one as he came slowly on he kept glancing at her she still with upturned face stood there in the attitude of an obedient child receiving admonition one cold little hand fluttered up to her silver cross ah he turned again understanding now the drift if not the inner meaning of that summons that had come your friend said something she nodded faintly riverwards towards the mission sign \"did you feel like that about it when you saw it first \" oh a i m not religious like the colonel she smiled and walked on at the door as she took the milk instead of \"thank you wait a moment \" she was back again directly you are going far beyond the mission so carry this with you i hope it will guide you as it guides us on his way back to the fathers house he kept looking at what sister winifred had given him a latin cross of silver scarce three inches long at the intersection of the arms it bore a chased lozenge on which was a mitre above it the word \"alaska and beneath the crossed keys of st peter and the letters p t r \" as he came near to where the colonel and his hosts were he slipped the cross into his pocket his fingers encountered muckluck s medal upon some wholly involuntary impulse he withdrew sister winifred s gift and transferred it to another pocket but he laughed to himself \"both sort o charms after all \" and again he looked at the big cross and the heaven above it and down at the domain of the inua the jealous god of the yukon twenty minutes later the two travellers were saying good bye to the men of holy cross and making their surprised and delighted acknowledgments for the brand new canvas cover they found upon the colonel s new sled oh it is not we said father brachet \"it is made by ze sisters zey shall know zat you were pleased \" father richmond held the boy s hand a moment i see you go my son but i shall see you return no father i shall hardly come this way again father brachet smiling watched them start up the long trail i sink we shall meet again were his last words what does he mean asked the colonel a little high and mightily what plan has he got for a meeting same plan as you ve got i s pose i believe you both call it heaven the holy cross thermometer had registered twenty degrees below zero but the keen wind blowing down the river made it seem more like forty below when they stopped to lunch they had to crouch down behind the sled to stand the cold and the boy found that his face and ears were badly frost bitten the colonel discovered that the same thing had befallen the toes of his left foot they rubbed the afflicted members and tried not to let their thoughts stray backwards the jesuits had told them of an inhabited cabin twenty three miles up the river and they tried to fix their minds on that in a desultory way when the wind allowed it they spoke of min ok and of odds and ends they d heard about the trail they spoke of the big chimney cabin and of how at anvik they would have their last shave the one subject neither seemed anxious to mention was holy cross it was a little \"marked the colonel felt but he wasn t going to say the first word since he meant to say the last about five o clock the gale went down but it came on to snow at seven the colonel said decidedly we can t make that cabin to night \" why not because i m not going any further with this foot he threw down the sled rope and limped after wood for the fire the boy tilted the sled up by an ice hummock and spread the new canvas so that it gave some scant shelter from the snow luckily for once the wind how grown quite lamb like for the yukon it would be thought a good stiff breeze almost anywhere else directly they had swallowed supper the colonel remarked \"i feel as ready for my bed as i did saturday night \" ah saturday night that was different they looked at each other with the same thought well that bed at holy cross isn t any whiter than this laughed the boy but the colonel was not to be deceived by this light and airy reference his own unwilling sentiments were a guide to the boy s and he felt it incumbent upon him to restore the holy cross incident to its proper proportions those last words of father brachet s bothered him had they been \"gettin at\" the boy you think all that mission business mighty wonderful just because you run across it in alaska and isn t it wonderful at all the boy spoke dreamily and from force of old habit held out his mittened hands to the unavailing fire the colonel gave a prefatory grunt of depreciation but he was pulling his blankets out from under the stuff on the sled the boy turned his head and watched him with a little smile \"i ll admit that i always used to think the jesuits were a shady lot \" so they are most of em well i don t know about most of em you and mac used to talk a lot about the motives of the few i do know but as far as i can see every creature who comes up to this country comes to take something out of it except those holy cross fellas they came to bring something the colonel had got the blankets out now but where was the rubber sheet he wouldn t sleep on it in this weather again for a kingdom but when the thaws came if those explorer fellas were right in his sense of irritation at a conscientious duty to perform and no clear notion of how to discharge it he made believe it was the difficulty in finding the rubber sheet he didn t want that made him out of sorts it s bitter work anyhow this making beds with your fingers stiff and raw he said is it dignity looked at impudence sitting in the shelter smiling humph just try it growled the colonel i s pose the man over the fire cookin supper does look better off than the pore pardner cuttin down trees and makin beds in the snow but he isn t oh isn t he it was all right but the big chimney boss felt he had chosen the lion s share of the work in electing to be woodman still it wasn t that that troubled him now what was it he had been going to say about the jesuits something very telling if you mean that you d rather go back to the cookin the boy was saying \" i m agreeable \" well you start in to morrow and see if you re so agreeable all right i think i dote on one job just about as much as i do on t other but still the colonel frowned he couldn t remember that excellent thing he had been going to say about romanists but he sniffed derisively and flung over his shoulder to hear you goin on anybody d think the jesuits were the only christians as if there weren t others who oh yes christians with gold shovels and winchester rifles i know em but if gold hadn t been found how many of the army that s invaded the north how many would be here if it hadn t been for the gold but all this holy cross business would be goin on just the same as it has done for years and years with a mighty tug the colonel dragged out the rubber blanket flung it down on the snow and squared himself back to the fire to make short work of such views i d no notion you were such a sucker you can bet he said darkly those fellas aren t making a bad thing out of that holy cross business as you call it i didn t mean business in that sense what else could they do if they didn t do this ask the same of any parson but the colonel didn t care to i suppose he said severely \"you could even make a hero out of that hang dog brother etienne \" no but he could do something else for he s served in the french army then there s that mad brother paul what good would he be at anything else well i don t know brachet and wills are decent enough men but where else would they have the power and the freedom they have at holy cross why they live there like feudal barons father richmond could have done anything he chose ah father richmond the colonel shut his mouth suddenly turned about and proceeded to crawl under his blankets feet to the fire well no answer well insisted the boy oh father richmond must have seen a ghost what take my word for it he got frightened somehow a man like father richmond has to be scared into a cassock the boy s sudden laughter deepened the colonel s own impression that the instance chosen had not been fortunate one man of courage knows another man of courage when he sees him and the colonel knew he had damned his own argument wouldn t care for the job myself the boy was saying what job scarin father richmond the boy sat watching the slow wet snow flakes fall and die in the fire his clothes were pretty damp but he was warm after a chilly fashion as warmth goes on the trail the colonel suddenly put his head out from under the marmot skin to say discontentedly \"what you sittin up for \" oh for instance but aside from the pertness of the answer already it was dimly recognised as an offence for one to stay up longer than the other can t think how it is the colonel growled \"that you don t see that their principle is wrong through and through mediaeval through and through despotic they make a virtue of weakness a fetich of vested authority and it isn t american authority either \" the boy waited for him to quiet down \"what s the first rule demanded the colonel half sitting up of the most powerful catholic order blind obedience to an old gentleman over in italy \" i said last night you know the boy put in quite meekly \"that it all seemed very un american \" huh glad you can see that much the colonel drove his huge fist at the provision bag as though to beat the stiffnecked beans into a feathery yielding \"blind submission don t come easy to most americans the great republic was built upon revolt \" and he pulled the covers over his head i know i know we jaw an awful lot about freedom and about what s american there s plenty o free speech in america and plenty o machinery but there s a great deal o human nature too i guess the boy looked out of the corner of his eye at the blanketed back of his big friend \"and maybe there ll always be some people who who think there s something in the new testament notion o sacrifice and service \" the colonel rolled like an angry leviathan and came to the surface to blow but the boy dashed on with a fearful joy in his own temerity the difference between us colonel is that i m an unbeliever and i know it and you re a cantankerous old heathen and you don t know it the colonel sat suddenly bolt upright \"needn t look at me like that you re as bad as anybody rather worse why are you here dazzled and lured by the great gold craze an you re not even poor you want more gold you ve got a home to stay in but you weren t satisfied not even in the fat lands down below \" well said the colonel solemnly blinking at the fire \"i hope i m a christian but as to bein satisfied \" church of england can t manage it hey church of england s got nothing to do with it it s a question o character satisfied we re little enough god knows but we re too big for that the boy stood up back to the fire eyes on the hilltops whitening in the starlight perhaps not all of us yes sah all of us the colonel lifted his head with a fierce look of most un christian pride behind him the hills leaving the struggling little wood far down the slope went up and up into dimness reaching to the near by stars and looking down to the far off camp fire by the great ice river s edge yes sah the colonel thundered again \"all that have got good fightin blood in em like you and me tisn t as if we came of any worn out frightened servile old stock you and i belong to the free livin hard ridin straight shootin southerners the people before us fought bears and fought indians and beat the british and when there wasn t anything else left to beat turned round and began to beat one another it was the one battle we found didn t pay we finished that job up in and since then we ve been lookin round for something else to beat we ve got down now to beatin records and foreign markets and breedin prize bulls but we don t breed cowards yet and we ain t lookin round for any asylums the catholic church is an asylum it s for people who never had any nerve or who have lost it \" the colonel turned about wagged his head defiantly at the icy hills and the night and in the after stillness fell sound asleep in the snow chapter xii the great white silence \" paa dit firmament den klare nordlyslampe taendt \" innocently thinking that they had seen arctic travelling at its worst and secretly looking upon themselves as highly accomplished trailmen they had covered the forty one miles from holy cross to anvik in less than three days the colonel made much of the pleasant and excellent man at the head of the episcopal mission there and the boy haunted benham s store picking up a little ingalik and the a c method of trading with the indians who day and night with a number of stranded klondykers congregated about the grateful warmth of the big iron stove the travellers themselves did some business with the a c agent laying in supplies of fresh meat and even augmenting their hitherto carefully restricted outfit for they were going far beyond the reach of stores or even of missions anvik was the last white settlement below nulato nulato was said to be over two hundred miles to the northward and yet after all their further preparation and expense each man kept saying in his heart during those first days out from anvik that the journey would be easy enough but for their \"comforts\" the burden on the sled by all the rules of arithmetic the daily subtraction of three meals from the store should have lightened the load it seemed to have the opposite effect by some process of evil enchantment every ounce grew to weigh a pound every pound a hundredweight the sled itself was bewitched recall how lightsomely it ran down the snowy slope from the big chimney cabin to the river trail that morning they set forth the boy took its pretty impetuosity for a happy augury the very sled was eager for the mighty undertaking but never in all that weary march did it manifest again any such modest alacrity if thereafter in the long going \"up river\" there came an interval of downhill the sled turned summersaults in the air wound its forward or backward rope round willow scrub or alder or else advanced precipitately with an evil low comedy air bottom side up to attack its master in the shins it either held back with a power superhuman or it lunged forward with a momentum that capsized its weary conductor its manners grew steadily worse as the travellers pushed farther and farther into the wilderness beyond the exorcising power of holy cross beyond the softening influences of christian hospitality at episcopal anvik even beyond tischsocket the last of the indian villages for a hundred miles the two who had been scornful of the frailty of temper they had seen common in men s dealings up here in the north began to realize that all other trials of brotherhood pale before the strain of life on the arctic trail beyond any question after a while something goes wrong with the nerves the huge drafts on muscular endurance have no doubt something to do with it they worked hard for fourteen sometimes seventeen hours at a stretch they were ill fed suffering from exposure intense cold and a haunting uncertainty of the end of the undertaking they were reasonable fellows as men go with a respect for each other but when hardship has got on the nerves when you are suffering the agonies of snow blindness sore feet and the pangs of hunger you are not to put it mildly at your best as a member of the social order they sometimes said things they were ashamed to remember but both men grew carefuller at crucial moments and the talkative one more silent as time went on by the rule of the day the hard shift before dinner usually fell to the boy it was the worst time in the twenty four hours and equally dreaded by both men it was only the first night out from anvik after an unusually trying day the boy was tramping heavily ahead bent like an old man before the cutting sleet fettered like a criminal hands behind back rope wound stiff straining at the burden of the slow and sullen sled on a sudden he stopped straightened his back and remonstrated with the colonel in unprintable terms for putting off the halt later than ever they had yet \"after such a day \" can t make fire with green cotton wood was the colonel s rejoiner then let s stop and rest anyhow nuh we know where that would land us men who stop to rest go to sleep in the snow and men who go to sleep in the snow on empty stomachs don t wake up they pushed on another mile when the colonel at last called the halt the boy sank down on the sled too exhausted to speak but it had grown to be a practice with them not to trust themselves to talk at this hour the colonel would give the signal to stop simply by ceasing to push the sled that the boy was wearily dragging the boy had invariably been feeling just as the colonel had before during his shift in front that the man behind wasn t helping all he might whereupon followed a vague consciously unreasonable but wholly irresistible rage against the partner of his toil but however much the man at the back was supposed to spare himself the man in front had never yet failed to know when the impetus from behind was really removed the boy sat now on the sled silent motionless while the colonel felled and chopped and brought the wood then the boy dragged himself up made the fire and the beef tea but still no word even after that reviving cup the usual signal for a few remarks and more social relations to be established tonight no sound out of either the colonel changed his footgear and the melted snow in the pot began to boil noisily but the boy who had again betaken himself to the sled didn t budge no man who really knows the trail would have dared under the circumstances to remind his pardner that it was now his business to get up and fry the bacon but presently without looking up the hungry colonel ventured get your dry things feet aren t wet don t talk foolishness here are your things the colonel flung in the boy s direction the usual change two pairs of heavy socks the german knitted and \"the felt \" not wet repeated the boy you know you are could go through water in these mucklucks i m not saying the wet has come in from outside but you know as well as i do a man sweats like a horse on the trail still the boy sat there with his head sunk between his shoulders first rule o this country is to keep your feet dry or else pneumonia rheumatism god knows what first rule o this country is mind your own business or else god knows what the colonel looked at the boy a moment and then turned his back the boy glanced up conscience stricken but still only half alive dulled by the weight of a crushing weariness the colonel presently bent over the fire and was about to lift off the turbulently boiling pot the boy sprang to his feet ready to shout \"you do your work and keep your hands off mine but the colonel turned just in time to say with unusual gentleness if you like i ll make supper to night \" and the boy catching his breath ran forward swaying a little half blind but with a different look in his tired eyes no no old man it isn t as bad as that and again it was two friends who slept side by side in the snow the next morning the colonel who had been kept awake half the night by what he had been thinking was neuralgia in his eyes woke late hearing the boy calling i say kentucky aren t you ever goin to get up get up said the colonel \"why should i when it s pitch dark \" what fire clean out eh but he smelt the tea and bacon and sat up bewildered with a hand over his smarting eyes the boy went over and knelt down by him looking at him curiously guess you re a little snow blind colonel but it won t last you know blind no no only snow blind big difference and he took out his rag of a handkerchief got some water in a tin cup and the eyes were bathed and bandaged it won t last you know you ll just have to take it easy for a few days the colonel groaned for the first time he seemed to lose heart he sat during breakfast with bandaged eyes and a droop of the shoulders that seemed to say old age had come upon him in a single night the day that followed was pretty dark to both men the boy had to do all the work except the monotonous blind pushing from behind in whatever direction the boy dragged the sled now snow blindness is not usually dangerous but it is horribly painful while it lasts your eyes swell up and are stabbed continually by cutting pains your head seems full of acute neuralgia and often there is fever and other complications the colonel s was a bad case but he was a giant for strength and \"sound as a dollar as the boy reminded him except for this little bother with your eyes and you re a whole heap better already \" at a very slow rate they plodded along they had got into a region where there was no timber but as they couldn t camp without a fire they took an extra rest that day at four o clock and regaled themselves on some cold grub then they took up the line of march again but they had been going only about half an hour when the colonel suddenly without warning stopped pushing the sled and stood stock still on the trail the boy feeling the removal of the pressure looked round went back to him and found nothing in particular was the matter but he just thought he wouldn t go any further we can camp here no we can t says the boy \"there isn t a tree in sight \" but the colonel seemed dazed he thought he d stop anyhow \"right where he was \" oh no says the boy a little frightened \"we ll camp the minute we come to wood \" but the colonel stood as if rooted the boy took his arm and led him on a few paces to the sled \"you needn t push hard you know just keep your hand there so without looking you ll know where i m going \" this was very subtle of the boy for he knew the colonel was blind as a bat and as sensitive as a woman \"we ll get through all right yet he called back as he stooped to take up the sledrope i bet on kentucky \" like a man walking in his sleep the colonel followed now holding on to the sled and unconsciously pulling a little and when the boy very nearly on his last legs remonstrated leaning against it and so urging it a little forward oh but the wood was far to seek that night concentrated on the two main things to carry forward his almost intolerable load and to go the shortest way to the nearest wood the boy by and by forgot to tell his tired nerves to take account of the unequal pressure from behind if he felt it well the colonel was a corker if he didn t feel it well the colonel was just about tuckered out it was very late when at last the boy raised a shout behind the cliff overhanging the river bed that they were just rounding there spread out in the sparkling starlight as far as he could see a vast primeval forest the boy bettered his lagging pace ha you haven t seen a wood like this since we left frisco it s all right now kentucky and he bent to his work with a will when he got to the edge of the wood he flung down the rope and turned to find himself alone colonel colonel where are you colonel he stood in the silence shivering with a sudden sense of desolation he took his bearings propped a fallen fir sapling aslant by the sled and forgetting he was ready to drop he ran swiftly hack along the way he came they had travelled all that afternoon and evening on the river ice hard as iron retaining no trace of footprint or of runner possible to verify even in daylight the yukon here was fully three miles wide they had meant to hug the right bank but snow and ice refashion the world and laugh at the trustful geography of men a traveller on this trail is not always sure whether he is following the mighty yukon or some slough equally mighty for a few miles or whether in the protracted twilight he has not wandered off upon some frozen swamp on the boy went in the ghostly starlight running stumbling calling at regular intervals his voice falling into a melancholy monotony that sounded foreign to himself it occurred to him that were he the colonel he wouldn t recognise it and he began instead to call \"kentucky ken tuck kee \" sounding those fine barbaric syllables for the first time most like in that world of ice and silence he stood an instant after his voice died and listened to the quiet yes the people were right who said nothing was so hard to bear in this country of hardship nothing ends by being so ghastly as the silence no bird stirs the swift flashing fish are sealed under ice the wood creatures gone to their underground sleep no whispering of the pointed firs stiff snowclotted no swaying of the scant herbage sheathed in ice or muffled under winter s wide white blanket no greater hush can reign in the interstellar spaces than in winter on the yukon colonel silence like a negation of all puny things friendship human life colonel silence no wonder men went mad up here when they didn t drown this silence in strong drink on and on he ran till he felt sure he must have passed the colonel unless yes there were those air holes in the river ice he felt choked and stopped to breathe should he go back it was horrible to turn it was like admitting that the man was not to be found that this was the end colonel he said to himself that he would go back and build a fire for a signal and return but he ran on farther and farther away from the sled and from the forest was it growing faintly light he looked up oh yes presently it would be brighter still those streamers of pale light dancing in the north they would be green and scarlet and orange and purple and the terrible white world would be illumined as by conflagration he stopped again that the colonel should have dropped so far back as this and the man in front not know it was incredible what was that a shadow on the ice a frozen hummock no a man was it really glory hallelujah it was but the shadow lay there ghastly still and the boy s greeting died in his throat he had found the colonel but he had found him delivered over to that treacherous sleep that seldom knows a waking the boy dropped down beside his friend and wasn t far off crying but it was a tonic to young nerves to see how like one dead the man lay there for all the calling and tugging by the arm the boy rolled the body over pulled open the things at the neck and thrust his hand down till he could feel the heart beating he jumped up got a handful of snow and rubbed the man s face with it at last a feeble protest an effort to get away from the boy s rude succour thank god colonel colonel wake up he shook him hard but the big man only growled sullenly and let his leaden weight drop back heavily on the ice the boy got hold of the neck of the colonel s parki and pulled him frantically along the ice a few yards and then realised that only the terror of the moment gave him the strength to do that much to drag a man of the colonel s weight all the way to the wood was stark impossibility he couldn t get him eighty yards if he left him and went for the sled and fuel the man would be dead by the time he got back if he stayed they would both be frozen in a few hours it was pretty horrible he felt faint and dizzy it occurred to him that he would pray he was an agnostic all right but the colonel was past praying for himself and here was his friend an agnostic here he was on his knees he hadn t prayed since he was a little chap down in the south how did the prayers go \"our father\" he looked up at the reddening aurora \"our father who art in heaven \" his eyes fell again on his friend he leapt to his feet like a wild animal and began to go at the colonel with his fists the blows rained thick on the chest of the prostrate man but he was too well protected to feel more than the shock but now they came battering down under the ear right left as the man turned blindly to avoid them on the jaw even on the suffering eyes and that at last stung the sleeper into something like consciousness he struggled to his feet with a roar like a wounded bull lunging heavily forward as the boy eluded him and he would have pounded the young fellow out of existence in no time had he stood his ground that was exactly what the boy didn t mean to do he was always just a little way on in front but as the colonel s half insane rage cooled and he slowed down a bit the boy was at him again like some imp of satan sound and lithe and quick handed as he was he was no match for the colonel at his best but the colonel couldn t see well and his brain was on fire he d kill that young devil and then he d lie down and sleep again meanwhile aurora mounted the high heavens from a great corona in the zenith all the sky was hung with banners and the snow was stained as if with blood the boy looked over his shoulder and saw the huge figure of his friend bearing down upon him with his discoloured face rage distorted and murder in his tortured eyes a moment s sense of the monstrous spectacle fell so poignant upon the boy that he felt dimly he must have been full half his life running this race with death followed by a maniac bent on murder in a world whose winter was strangely lit with the leaping fires of hell at last on there in front the cliff below it the sharp bend in the river and although he couldn t see it yet behind the cliff the forest and a little hand sled bearing the means of life the colonel was down again but it wasn t safe to go near him just yet the boy ran on unpacked the sled and went axe in hand along the margin of the wood never before was a fire made so quickly then with the flask back to the colonel almost as sound asleep as before the boy never could recall much about the hours that followed there was nobody to help so it must have been he who somehow got the colonel to the fire got him to swallow some food plastered his wounded face over with the carbolic ointment and got him into bed for in the morning all this was seen to have been done they stayed in camp that day to \"rest up and the boy shot a rabbit the colonel was coming round the rest or the ointment or the tea leaf poultice had been good for snowblindness the generous reserve of strength in his magnificent physique was quick to announce itself he was still frightfully bunged up but i think we ll push on to morrow he said that night as he sat by the fire smoking before turning in right you are \" said the boy who was mending the sled runner neither had referred to that encounter on the river ice that had ended in bringing the colonel where there was succour nothing was said then or for long after in the way of deliberate recognition that the boy had saved his life it wasn t necessary they understood each other but in the evening after the boy had finished mending the sled it occurred to him he must also mend the colonel before they went to bed he got out the box of ointment and bespread the strips of torn handkerchief don t know as i need that to night says the colonel \"musn t waste ointment \" but the boy brought the bandages round to the colonel s side of the fire for an instant they looked at each other by the flickering light and the colonel laid his hand on the boy s arm his eyes looked worse for the moment and began to water he turned away brusquely and knocked the ashes out of his pipe on a log what in hell made you think of it ask me an easy one says the boy \"but i know what the jesuit fathers would say \" jesuits and george warren humph precious little we d agree about you would about this it flashed over me when i looked back and saw you peltin after me small wonder i made for you i m not findin fault but what on earth put it into your head to go at me with your fists like that you ll never prove it by me but when i saw you comin at me like a mad bull i thought to myself thinks i the colonel and the jesuits they d both of em say this was a direct answer to prayer chapter xiii the pit l humanit a commenc tout enti re par le crime c tait le vieux nourricier des hommes des cavernes anatole france an old story now these days of silent plodding through the driving snow but if outward conditions lacked variety not so their cumulative effect upon poor human nature a change was going on in the travellers that will little commend them to the sentimentalist i ve come to think a snow storm s all right to travel in all right to sleep in said the colonel one morning \"but to cook in eat in make or break camp in it s the devil s champion invention \" for three days they had worked like galley slaves and yet covered less than ten miles a day \"and you never get rested the colonel went on i get up as tired as i go to bed \" again the boy only nodded his body if not his temper had got broken into the trail but for a talkative person he had in these days strangely little to say it became manifest that in the long run the colonel would suffer the most physically but his young companion having less patience and more ambition more sheer untamed vitality in him would suffer the most in spirit every sense in him was becoming numbed save the gnawing in his stomach and that other even more acute ache queer compound of fatigue and anger these two sensations swallowed up all else and seemed to grow by what they fed on the loaded sled was a nightmare it weighed a thousand tons the very first afternoon out from anvik when in the desperate hauling and tugging that rescued it from a bottomless snow drift the lashing slipped the load loosened tumbled off and rolled open the colonel stood quite still and swore till his half frozen blood circulated freely again when it came to repacking he considered in detail the items that made up the intolerable weight and fell to wondering which of them they could do without the second day out from anvik they had decided that it was absurd after all to lug about so much tinware they left a little saucepan and the extra kettle at that camp the idea so potent at anvik of having a tea kettle in reserve well the notion lost weight and the kettle seemed to gain two pairs of boots and some flannels marked the next stopping place on the following day when the boy s rifle kept slipping and making a brake to hold back the sled \"i reckon you ll have to plant that rifle o yours in the next big drift said the colonel one s all we need anyway \" one s all you need and one s all i need answered the boy stiffly but it wasn t easy to see immediate need for either never was country so bare of game they thought not considering how little they hunted and how more and more every faculty every sense was absorbed in the bare going forward the next time the colonel said something about the uselessness of carrying two guns the boy flared up \"if you object to guns leave yours \" this was a new tone for the boy to use to the colonel don t you think we d better hold on to the best one now the boy couldn t deny that the colonel s was the better but none the less he had a great affection for his own old marlin and the colonel shouldn t assume that he had the right to dictate this attitude of the \"wise elder\" seemed out of place on the trail a gun s a necessity i haven t brought along any whim whams who has well it wasn t me that went loadin up at anvik with fool thermometers and things thermometer why it doesn t weigh weighs something and it s something to pack frozen half the time too and when it isn t what s the good of havin it hammered into us how near we are to freezin to death but it annoyed him to think how very little in argument a thermometer weighed against a rifle they said no more that day about lightening the load but with a double motive they made enormous inroads upon their provisions a morning came when the colonel packing hurriedly in the biting cold forgot to shove his pardner s gun into its accustomed place the boy returning from trail breaking to the river kicked at the butt to draw attention to the omission the colonel flung down the end of the ice coated rope he had lashed the load with and \"pack it yourself says he the boy let the rifle lie but all day long he felt the loss of it heavy on his heart and no reconciling lightness in the sled the colonel began to have qualms about the double rations they were using it was only the seventeenth night after turning their backs on the big chimney as the colonel tipped the pan pouring out half the boiled beans into his pardner s plate that s the last o the strawberries don t go expectin any more says he what \" ejaculated the boy aghast then quickly to keep a good face you take my life when you do take the beans whereby i live when the colonel had disposed of his strawberries \"lord \" he sighed trying to rub the stiffness out of his hands over the smoke \"the appetite a fella can raise up here is something terrible you eat and eat and it doesn t seem to make any impression you re just as hungry as ever \" \"and the stuff a fella can eat \" the colonel recalled that speech of the boy s the very next night when after \"a hell of a time\" getting the fire alight he was bending forward in that attitude most trying to maintain holding the frying pan at long range over the feebly smoking sticks he had to cook to live on snow shoes nowadays for the heavy colonel had illustrated oftener than the boy that going without meant breaking in floundering and finally having to call for your pardner to haul you out this was one of the many uses of a pardner on the trail the last time the colonel had trusted to the treacherous crust he had gone in head foremost and the boy happening to look round saw only two snow shoes bottom side up moving spasmodically on the surface of the drift the colonel was nearly suffocated by the time he was pulled out and after that object lesson he stuck to snow shoes every hour of the twenty four except those spent in the sleeping bag but few things on earth are more exasperating than trying to work mounted on clumsy long web feet that keep jarring against yet holding you off from the tree you are felling or the fire you are cooking over you are constrained to stand wholly out of natural relation to the thing you are trying to do the thing you ve got to do if you mean to come out alive the colonel had been through all this time and time again but as he squatted on his heels to night cursing the foot and a half of snow shoe that held him away from the sullen fire straining every muscle to keep the outstretched frying pan over the best of the blaze he said to himself that what had got him on the raw was that speech of the boy s yesterday about the stuff he had to eat if the boy objected to having his rice parboiled in smoked water he was damned unreasonable that was all the culprit reappeared at the edge of the darkening wood he came up eagerly and flung down an armful of fuel for the morning hoping to find supper ready since it wasn t he knew that he mustn t stand about and watch the preparations by this time he had learned a good deal of the trail man s unwritten law on no account must you hint that the cook is incompetent or even slow any more than he may find fault with your moment for calling halt or with your choice of timber so the woodman turned wearily away from the sole spot of brightness in the waste and went back up the hill in the dark and the cold to busy himself about his own work even to spin it out if necessary till he should hear the gruff \"grub s ready \" and when that dinner gong sounds don t you dally don t you wait a second you may feel uncomfortable if you find yourself twenty minutes late for a dinner in london or new york but to be five minutes late for dinner on the winter trail is to lay up lasting trouble by the time the rice and bacon were done and the flap jack still raw in the middle was burnt to charcoal on both sides the colonel s eyes were smarting in the acrid smoke and the tears were running down his cheeks grub s ready the boy came up and dropped on his heels in the usual attitude the colonel tore a piece off the half charred half raw pancake maybe you ll think the fire isn t thoroughly distributed but that s got to do for bread he remarked severely as if in reply to some objection the boy saw that something he had said or looked had been misinterpreted hey too much fire outside and not enough in well sir i ll trust my stomach to strike a balance guess the heat ll get distributed all right once i ve swallowed it when the colonel mollified said something about cinders in the rice the boy with his mouth full of grit answered \"i m pretendin it s sugar \" not since the episode of the abandoned rifle had he shown himself so genial never in all my bohn life says the colonel after eating steadily for some time \"never in a year sah have i thought as much about food as i do in a day on this trail \" same here and it s quantity not quality ditto the boy turned his head sharply away from the fire \"hear that \" no need to ask the colonel had risen upright on his cramped legs red eyes starting out of his head the boy got up turned about in the direction of the hollow sound and made one step away from the fire you stay right where you are ordered the colonel quite in the old way hey that s a bird song thought so mr wolf smelt the cookin want s the rest of the pack to know there s something queer up here on the hill then as the boy moved to one side in the dark \"what you lookin for \" my gun mine s here oh yes his own old marlin was lying far down the river under eight and fifty hours of snow it angered him newly and more than ever to remember that if he had a shot at anything now it must needs be by favour of the colonel they listened for that sound again the first since leaving anvik not made by themselves seems a lot quieter than it did observed the colonel by and bye the boy nodded without preface the colonel observed \"it s five days since i washed my face and hands \" what s the good o rememberin returned the boy sharply then more mildly \"people talk about the bare necessaries o life well sir when they re really bare you find there ain t but three food warmth sleep \" again in the distance that hollow baying food warmth sleep repeated the colonel \"we ve about got down to the wolf basis \" he said it half in defiance of the trail s fierce lessoning but it was truer than he knew they built up the fire to frighten off the wolves but the colonel had his rifle along when they went over and crawled into their sleeping bag half in half out he laid the gun carefully along the right on his snow shoes as the boy buttoned the fur lined flap down over their heads he felt angrier with the colonel than he had ever been before took good care to hang on to his own shootin iron suppose anything should happen and he said it over and over exactly what could happen he did not make clear the real danger was not from wolves but it was something and he would need a rifle and he wouldn t have one and it was the colonel s fault now it had long been understood that the woodman is lord of the wood when it came to the colonel s giving unasked advice about the lumber business the boy turned a deaf ear and thought well of himself for not openly resenting the interference the colonel talks an awful lot anyway he has more hot air to offer than muscle when they sighted timber that commended itself to the woodman if he thought well of it why he just dropped the sled rope without a word pulled the axe out of the lashing trudged up the hillside holding the axe against his shirt underneath his parki till he reached whatever tree his eye had marked for his own off with the fur mitt and bare hand protected by the inner mitt of wool he would feel the axe head for there was always the danger of using it so cold that the steel would chip and fly as soon as he could be sure the proper molecular change had been effected he would take up his awkward attitude before the selected spruce leaning far forward on his snow shoes and seeming to deliver the blows on tip toe but the real trouble came when after felling the dead tree splitting an armful of fuel and carrying it to the colonel he returned to the task of cutting down the tough green spruce for their bedding many strained blows must be delivered before he could effect the chopping of even a little notch then he would shift his position and cut a corresponding notch further round so making painful circuit of the bole to night what with being held off by his snow shoes what with utter weariness and a dulled axe he growled to himself that he was only gnawin a ring round the tree like a beaver damn the whole wait perhaps the cursed snow was packed enough now to bear he slipped off the web feet and standing gingerly but blessedly near made effectual attack hooray one more good un and the thing was down hah ugh woof ff the tree was down but so was he floundering breast high and at every effort to get out only breaking down more of the crust and sinking deeper this was not the first time such a thing had happened why did he feel as if it was for him the end of the world he lay still an instant it would be happiness just to rest here and go to sleep the colonel oh well the colonel had taken his rifle funny there should be orange trees up here he could smell them he shut his eyes something shone red and glowing why that was the sun making an effect of stained glass as it shone through the fat pine weather boarding of his little bedroom on the old place down in florida suddenly a face ah that face he must be up and doing he knew perfectly well how to get out of this damn hole you lie on your side and roll gradually you pack the softness tight till it bears not if you stand up on your feet but bears the length of your body while you worm your way obliquely to the top and feel gingerly in the dimness after your snow shoes but if it happens on a pitch dark night and your pardner has chosen camp out of earshot you feel that you have looked close at the end of the long trail on getting back to the fire he found the colonel annoyed at having called \"grub \" three times \"yes sah three times sah \" and they ate in silence now i m going to bed said the boy rising stiffly you just wait a minute no now the colonel himself had enunciated the law that whenever one of them was ready to sleep the other must come too he didn t know it but it is one of the iron rules of the winter trail in absence of its enforcement the later comer brings into the warmed up sleeping bag not only the chill of his own body he lets in the bitter wind and brings along whatever snow and ice is clinging to his boots and clothes the melting and warming up is all to be done again but the colonel was angry most unreasonable he muttered \"damned unreasonable \" worse than the ice and the wet in the sleeping bag was this lying in such close proximity to a young jackanapes who wouldn t come when you called \"grub \" and wouldn t wait a second till you d felt about in the dimness for your gun hideous to lie so close to a man who snored and who d deprived you of your marlin although it meant life the boy grudged the mere animal heat that he gave and that he took full of grudging he dropped asleep but the waking spirit followed him into his dreams an ugly picture painted itself upon the dark and struggling against the vision he half awoke with the first returning consciousness came the oppression of the yoke the impulse to match the mental alienation with that of the body strong need to move away you can t move away in a sleeping bag in a city you may be alone free on the trail you walk in bonds with your yoke fellow make your bed with him with him rise up and with him face the lash the livelong day well sighed the colonel after toiling onward for a couple of hours the next morning \"this is the worst yet \" but by the middle of the afternoon \"what did i say why this morning everything up till now has been child s play \" he kept looking at the boy to see if he could read any sign of halt in the tense scarred face certainly the wind was worse the going was worse the sled kept breaking through and sinking to the level of the load there it went in again they tugged and hauled and only dragged the lashing loose while the sled seemed soldered to the hard packed middle of the drift as they reloaded the thermometer came to light the colonel threw it out with never a word they had no clothes now but what they stood in and only one thing on the sled they could have lived without their money a packet of trading stores but they had thrown away more than they knew day by day not flannels and boots alone not merely extra kettle thermometer and gun went overboard but some grace of courtesy some decency of life had been left behind about three o clock of this same day dim with snow and dizzy in a hurricane of wind \"we can t go on like this said the boy suddenly wish i knew the way we could go on returned the colonel stopping with an air of utter helplessness and forcing his rigid hands into his pockets the boy looked at him the man of dignity and resource who had been the boss of the big chimney camp what had become of him here was only a big slouching creature with ragged beard smoke blackened countenance and eyes that wept continually come on said his equally ruffianly looking pardner we ll both go ahead \" so they abandoned their sled for awhile and when they had forged a way came back and one pulling the other pushing lifting guiding between them with infinite pains they got their burden to the end of the beaten track left it and went ahead again travelling three miles to make one what s the matter now the boy was too tired to turn his head round and look back but he knew that the other man wasn t doing his share he remembered that other time when the colonel had fallen behind it seemed years ago and even further away was the vague recollection of how he d cared how horribly frightened he d been wasn t he frightened now no it was only a dull curiosity that turned him round at last to see what it was that made the colonel peg out this time he was always peggin out yes there he was stoppin to stroke himself trail man an old woman fit only for the chimney corner and even when they went on again he kept saying to himself as he bent to the galling strain \"an old woman just an old woman \" till he made a refrain of the words and in the level places marched to the tune after that whatever else his vague thought went off upon it came back to \"an old woman just an old woman \" it was at a bad place towards the end of that forced march that the colonel instead of lifting the back of the sled bore hard on the handle bar with a vicious sound it snapped the boy turned heavily at the noise when he saw the colonel standing dazed with the splintered bar in his hand his dull eyes flashed with sudden vigour he ran back to see the extent of the damage well it s pretty discouragin says the colonel very low the boy gritted his teeth with suppressed rage it was only a chance that it hadn t happened when he himself was behind but he couldn t see that no it was the colonel s bungling tryin to spare himself leanin on the bar instead o liftin the sled as he the boy would have done with stiff hands they tried to improvise a makeshift with a stick of birch and some string don t know what you think says the colonel presently \"but i call this a desperate business we ve undertaken \" the boy didn t trust himself to call it anything with a bungled job they went lamely on the loose snow was whirling about so it was impossible to say whether it was still falling or only hurricane driven to the colonel s great indignation it was later than usual before they camped not a word was spoken by either till they had finished their first meal and the colonel had melted a frying pan full of snow preparatory to the second he took up the rice bag held it by the top and ran his mittened hand down the gathered sack till he had outlined the contents at the bottom lord that s all there is the boy only blinked his half shut eyes the change in him from talkativeness to utter silence had grown horribly oppressive to the colonel he often felt he d like to shake him till he shook some words out \"i told you days ago he went on that we ought to go on rations \" silence but no you knew so much better the boy shut his eyes and suddenly like one struggling against sleep or swooning he roused himself i thought i knew the more we took off the damn sled the lighter it d be tisn t so and we didn t either of us think we d come down from eighteen miles a day to six returned the colonel a little mollified by any sort of answer \"i don t believe we re going to put this job through \" now this was treason any trail man may think that twenty times a day but no one ought to say it the boy set his teeth and his eyes closed the whole thing was suddenly harder doubt of the issue had been born into the world but he opened his eyes again the colonel had carefully poured some of the rice into the smoky water of the pan what was the fool doing such a little left and making a second supper only that morning the boy had gone a long way when mentally he called the boss of the big chimney camp \"an old woman \" by night he was saying in his heart \"the colonel s a fool \" his pardner caught the look that matched the thought no more second helpin s he said in self defence \"this ll freeze into cakes for luncheon \" no answer no implied apology for that look in the tone his pardner had come to dread the colonel began \"if we don t strike a settlement to morrow \" don t talk the boy s tired arm fell on the handle of the frying pan over it went rice water and all in the fire the culprit sprang up speechless with dismay enraged at the loss of the food he was hungry for enraged at \"the fool fry pan\" enraged at the fool colonel for balancing it so badly a column of steam and smoke rose into the frosty air between the two men as it cleared away a little the boy could see the colonel s bloodshot eyes the expression was ill to meet when they crouched down again with the damped out fire between them a sense of utter loneliness fell upon each man s heart the next morning when they came to digging the sled out of the last night s snow drift the boy found to his horror that he was weaker yes a good deal as they went on he kept stumbling the colonel fell every now and then sometimes he would lie still before he could pull himself on his legs again in these hours they saw nothing of the grim and splendid waste nothing of the ranks of snow laden trees nothing of sun course or of stars only the half yard of dazzling trail in front of them and clairvoyant the little store of flour and bacon that seemed to shrink in the pack while they dragged it on apart from partial snow blindness which fell at intervals upon the colonel the tiredness of the eyes was like a special sickness upon them both for many hours together they never raised their lids looking out through slits cat like on the world they had not spoken to each other for many days or was it only hours when the colonel looking at the boy said you ve got to have a face guard those frostbites are eating in xpect so you ought to stop it make a guard out of a snow ball or chunk o ice cut a piece out o the canvas o the bag but he didn t the big sores seemed such small matters beside the vast overshadowing doubt shall we come out of this alive doubt never to be openly admitted by him but always knocking knocking you can t see your own face the colonel persisted one piece o luck anyhow the old habit of looking after the boy died hard the colonel hesitated for the last time he would remonstrate \"i used to think frost bite was a figure o speech said he but the teeth were set in your face sonny and they ve bitten deep they ll leave awful scars \" battles do i b lieve and it was with an effort that he remembered there had been a time when they had been uncomfortable because they hadn t washed their faces now one man was content to let the very skin go if he could keep the flesh on his face and one was little concerned even for that life life to push on and come out alive the colonel had come to that point where he resented the boy s staying power terrified at the indomitable young life in him yes the colonel began to feel old and to think with vague wrath of the insolence of youth each man fell to considering what he would do how he would manage if he were alone and there ceased to be any terror in the thought if it wasn t for him so and so till in the gradual deadening of judgment all the hardship was somehow your pardner s fault your nerves made him responsible even for the snow and the wind by and by he was the enemy not but what each had occasional moments of lucidity and drew back from the pit they were bending over but the realisation would fade no longer did even the wiser of the two remember that this is that same abyss out of which slowly painfully the race has climbed with the lessened power to keep from falling in the terror of it lessened many strange things grew natural it was no longer difficult or even shocking to conceive one s partner giving out and falling by the way although playing about the thought the one thing that not even the colonel was able actually to realise was the imminent probability of death for himself imagination always pictured the other fellow down one s self somehow forging ahead this obsession ended on the late afternoon when the colonel broke silence by saying suddenly we must camp i m done he flung himself down under a bare birch and hid his face the boy remonstrated grew angry then with a huge effort at self control pointed out that since it had stopped snowing this was the very moment to go on why you can see the sun three of em look colonel but arctic meteorological phenomena had long since ceased to interest the kentuckian parhelia were less to him than covered eyes and the perilous peace of the snow it seemed a long time before he sat up and began to beat the stiffness out of his hands against his breast but when he spoke it was only to say i mean to camp for how long till a team comes by or something the boy got up abruptly slipped on his snow shoes and went round the shoulder of the hill and up on to the promontory to get out of earshot of that voice and determine which of the two ice roads stretching out before them was main channel and which was tributary he found on the height only a cutting wind and little enlightenment as to the true course north and east all nimbus still a brace of sun dogs following the pale god of day across the narrow field of primrose that bordered the dun coloured west there would be more snow to morrow and meanwhile the wind was rising again yes sir it was a mean outlook as he took mac s aneroid barometer out of his pocket a sudden gust cut across his raw and bleeding cheek he turned abruptly the barometer slipped out of his numb fingers he made a lunge to recover it clutched the air and sliding suddenly forward over he went flying headlong down the steep escarpment he struck a jutting rock only half snowed under that broke the sheer face of the promontory and he bounded once like a rubber ball struck a second time caught desperately at a solitary clump of ice sheathed alders crashed through the snow crust just below them and was held there like a mudlark in its cliff nest halfway between bluff and river his last clear thought had been an intense anxiety about his snow shoes as they sailed away two liberated kites but as he went on falling clutching at the air falling and felt the alder twigs snap under his hands he said to himself \"this is death but calmly as if it were a small matter compared to losing one s snow shoes it was only when he landed in the snow that he was conscious of any of the supposed natural excitement of a man meeting a violent end it was then before he even got his breath back that he began to struggle frantically to get a foothold but he only broke down more of the thin ice wall that kept him from the sheer drop to the river sixty or seventy feet below he lay quite still would the colonel come after him if he did come would he risk his life to if he did risk his life was it any use to try to he craned his neck and looked up blinked shut his eyes and lay back in the snow with a sound of far off singing in his head any use \" no sir it just about wasn t that bluff face would be easier to climb up than to climb down and either was impossible then it was that a great tide of longing swept over him a flood of passionate desire for more of this doubtful blessing life all the bitter hardship why how sweet it was after all to battle and to overcome it was only this lying helpless trapped that was evil the endless trail why it was only the coming to the end that a man minded suddenly the beauty that for days had been veiled shone out nothing in all the earth was glorious with the glory of the terrible white north and he had only just been wakened to it here now lying in his grave had come this special revelation of the rapture of living and the splendour of the visible universe the sky over his head he had called it \"a mean outlook and turned away it was the same sky that bent over him now with a tenderness that made him lift his cramped arms with tears as a sick child might to its mother the haloed sun with his attendant dogs how little the wonder had touched him never had he seen them so dim and sad as to night saying good bye to one who loved the sun the great frozen road out of sight below road that came winding winding down out of the arctic circle what other highway so majestic mysterious shining and beckoning on an earthly milky way leading to the golden paradise he had been travelling towards since summer and he was to go no further not till the june rains and thaws and winds and floods should carry him back as he had foreseen far below there at holy cross with a sharp contraction of the heart he shut his eyes again when he opened them they rested on the alder twig a couple of yards above holding out mocking finger tips and he turned his head in the snow till again he could see the mock suns looking down as well try to reach the sky as reach the alder bush what did that mean that he was really going to lie there till he died he die and the colonel and everybody else go on living \" he half rose on his elbow at the monstrous absurdity of the idea \"i won t die \" he said out loud crack crack warned the ice crust between him and that long fall to the river with horror at his heart he shrank away and hugged the face of the precipice presently he put out his hand and broke the ice crust above with mittened fists and palms he pounded firm a little ledge of snow reaching out further he broke the crust obliquely just above and having packed the snow as well as he could immediately about and moving lengthwise with an infinite caution he crawled up the few inches to the narrow ledge balancing his stiff body with a nicety possible only to acrobat or sleep walker it was in no normal state of ordinary waking senses that the work went on with never a downward look nor even up eyes riveted to the patch of snow on which the mittened hands fell as steady and untrembling as steel hammers in the seconds of actual consciousness of his situation that twice visited him he crouched on the ledge with closed eyes in the clutch of an overmastering horror absolutely still like a bird in the talons of a hawk each time when he opened his eyes he would stare at the snow ledge till hypnotised into disregard of danger balance his slight body lift one hand and go on pounding firm another shallow step when he reached the alder bush his heart gave a great leap of triumph then for the first time since starting he looked up his heart fell down it seemed farther than ever and the light waning but the twilight would be long he told himself and in that other beneficent inner twilight he worked on packing the snow and crawling gingerly up the perilous stair a half inch at a time at last he was on the jutting rock and could stand secure but here he could see that the top of the bluff really did shelve over to think so is so common an illusion to the climber that the boy had heartened himself by saying when he got there he would find it like the rest horribly steep but not impossible well it was impossible after all his labour he was no better off on the rock than in the snow hole below the alder down there where he dared not look the sun and his dogs had travelled down down they touched the horizon while he sat there they slipped below the world s wide rim he said in his heart i m freezing to death unexpectedly to himself his despair found voice colonel hello he started violently had he really heard that or was imagination playing tricks with echo colonel where the devil a man s head appeared out of the sky got the rope words indistinguishable floated down the head withdrawn silence the boy waited a very long time but he stamped his feet and kept his blood in motion the light was very grey when the head showed again at the sky line he couldn t hear what was shouted down and it occurred to him even in his huge predicament that the colonel was \"giving him hot air\" as usual instead of a life line down the rope came nearer and stopped about fifteen feet over his head got the axe let her down the night was bright with moonlight when the boy stood again on the top of the bluff humph says the colonel with agreeable anticipation \"you ll be glad to camp for a few days after this i reckon \" reckon i won t in their colossal fatigue they slept the clock round their watches run down their sense of the very date blurred since the colonel had made the last laconic entry in the journal was it three days or two or twenty in spite of a sensation as of many broken bones the boy put on the colonel s snow shoes and went off looking along the foot of the cliff for his own no luck but he brought back some birch bark and a handful of willow withes and set about making a rude substitute before they had despatched breakfast the great red moon arose so it was not morning but evening so much the better the crust would be firmer the moon was full it was bright enough to travel and travel they must no said the colonel with a touch of his old pompous authority we ll wait awhile the boy simply pointed to the flour bag there wasn t a good handful left they ate supper studiously avoiding each other s eyes in the background of the boy s mind \"he saved my life but he ran no risk and i saved his we re quits \" in the colonel s vague insistent stirred the thought \"i might have left him there to rot half way up the precipice oh he d go and he d take the sled no \" his vanished strength flowed back upon a tide of rage only one sleeping bag one kettle one axe one pair of snow shoes one gun no by the living lord not while i have a gun where s my gun he looked about guiltily under his lowered lids what no yes it was gone who packed at the last camp why he himself and he d left it behind then it was because i didn t see it the boy took care i shouldn t see it very likely he buried it so that i shouldn t see it he yes if i refuse to go on he and the boy seeing without looking taking in every move every shade in the mood of the broken spirited man ready to die here like a dog in the snow instead of pressing on as long as he could crawl the boy in a fever of silent rage called him that \"meanest word in the language a quitter \" and as surreptitiously he took in the vast discouragement of the older man there was nothing in the boy s changed heart to say \"poor fellow if he can t go on i ll stay and die with him\" but only \"he s got to go on and if he refuses well \" he felt about in his deadened brain and the best he could bring forth was \"i won t leave him yet \" a mighty river jam had forced them up on the low range of hills it was about midnight to judge by the moon clear of snow and the wind down the boy straightened up at a curious sight just below them something black in the moonlight the colonel paused looked down and passed his hand over his eyes the boy had seen the thing first and had said to himself \"looks like a sled but it s a vision it s come to seeing things now \" when he saw the colonel stop and stare he threw down his rope and began to laugh for there below were the blackened remains of a big fire silhouetted sharply on the snow looks like we ve come to a camp boss he hadn t called the colonel by the old nickname for many a day he stood there laughing in an idiotic kind of way wrapping his stiff hands in his parki indian fashion and looking down to the level of the ancient river terrace where the weather stained old indian sled was sharply etched on the moonlit whiteness just a sled lying in the moonlight but the change that can be wrought in a man s heart upon sight of a human sign it may be idle to speak of that to any but those who have travelled the desolate ways of the north side by side the two went down the slope slid and slipped and couldn t stop themselves till they were below the landmark looking up they saw that a piece of soiled canvas or a skin held down with a drift log fell from under the sled porti re wise from the top of the terrace straight down to the sheltered level where the camp fire had been coming closer they saw the curtain was not canvas but dressed deerskin indians said the colonel but with the rubbing out of other distinctions this too was curiously faint just so there were human beings it seemed enough within four feet of the deerskin door the colonel stopped shot through by a sharp misgiving what was behind a living man s camp or a dead man s tomb succour or some stark picture of defeat and of their own oncoming doom the colonel stood stock still waiting for the boy for the first time in many days even he hung back he seemed to lack the courage to be the one to extinguish hope by the mere drawing of a curtain from a snow drift s face the kentuckian pulled himself together and went forward he lifted his hand to the deerskin but his fingers shook so he couldn t take hold hello he called no sound again \"hello \" who s there the two outside turned and looked into each other s faces but if you want to know all the moment meant you must travel the winter trail chapter xiv kurilla and i swear to you athenians by the dog i swear for i must tell you the truth socrates the voice that had asked the question belonged to one of two stranded klondykers as it turned out who had burrowed a hole in the snow and faced it with drift wood they had plenty of provisions enough to spare and meant to stay here till the steamers ran for the younger of the pair had frosted his feet and was crippled the last of their dogs had been frozen to death a few miles back on the trail and they had no idea apparently how near they were to that first indian settlement this side of kaltag reached by the colonel and the boy after two days of rest and one day of travel no one ever sailed more joyfully into the bay of naples or saw with keener rapture constantinople s mosques and minarets arise than did these ice armoured travellers rounding the sharp bend in the river sight the huts and hear the dogs howl on the farther shore first thing i do sah is to speculate in a dog team said the colonel most of the bucks were gone off hunting and most of the dogs were with them only three left in the village but they were wonderful fellows those three where were they well the old man you see before you me got two he led the way behind a little shack a troop of children following and there were two wolf dogs not in the best condition one reddish with a white face and white forelegs the other grey with a black splotch on his chest and a white one on his back how much fiftee dolla and this one fiftee dolla as the colonel hesitated the old fellow added \"bohf eightee dolla \" oh eightee for the two he nodded well where s the other hein the other the third dog two are no good yes yes he said angrily \"heap good dog \" well i ll give you eighty dollars for these the ingalik taking a pipe out of his parki held out one empty hand \"but who s got the other \" for answer a head shake the outstretched hand and the words eightee dolla tabak tea wait interrupted the boy turning to the group of children \"where s the other dog \" nobody answered the boy pantomimed \"we want three dogs \" he held up as many fingers \"we got two see must have one more \" a lad of about thirteen turned and began pointing with animation towards a slowly approaching figure peetka him got the old man began to chatter angrily and abuse the lad for introducing a rival on the scene the strangers hailed the new comer how much is your dog peetka stopped considered studied the scene immediately before him and then the distant prospect you got dog he nodded well how much sixty dolla one dog sixty he nodded but this man says the price is eighty for two my dog him leader after some further conversation \"where is your dog \" demanded the colonel the new comer whistled and called after some waiting and well simulated anger on the part of the owner along comes a dusky siwash thin but keen looking and none too mild tempered the children all brightened and craned as if a friend or at least a highly interesting member of the community had appeared on the scene the nigger s the best whispered the boy him bully said the lad and seemed about to pat him but the siwash snarled softly raising his lip and showing his gleaming fangs the lad stepped back respectfully but grinned reiterating \"bully dog \" well i ll give you fifty for him said the colonel sixty well all right since he s a leader sixty the owner watched the dog as it walked round its master smelling the snow then turning up its pointed nose interrogatively and waving its magnificent feathery tail the oblique eyes acute angle of his short ears the thick neck broad chest and heavy forelegs gave an impression of mingled alertness and strength you will not see surpassed in any animal that walks the world jet black except for his grey muzzle and broad chest he looks at you with the face of his near ancestor the grizzled wolf if on short acquaintance you offer any familiarity as the colonel ventured to do and he shows his double row of murderous looking fangs the reminder of his fierce forefathers is even more insistent indeed to this day your siwash of this sort will have his moments of nostalgia in which he turns back to his wild kinsfolk and mates again with the wolf when the leader looked at the colonel with that indescribably horrid smile the owner s approval of the proud beast seemed to overcome his avarice me no sell he decided abruptly and walked off in lordly fashion with his dusky companion at his side the leader curling his feathery tail arc like over his back and walking with an air princes might envy the colonel stood staring vainly the boy called \"come back look here hi \" neither siwash nor ingalik took the smallest notice the boy went after them eliciting only airs of surly indifference and repeated me no sell it was a bitter disappointment especially to the boy he liked the looks of that nigger dog when plunged in gloom he returned to the group about the colonel he found his pardner asking about feed no the old man hadn t enough fish to spare even a few days supply would anybody here sell fish no he didn t think so all the men who had teams were gone to the hills for caribou there was nobody to send to the summer caches he held out his hand again for the first instalment of the \"eightee dolla in kind that he might put it in his pipe but dogs are no good to us without something to feed em \" the ingalik looked round as one seeking counsel get fish tomalla no sir to day s the only day in my calendar no buy dogs till we get fish when the negotiations fell through the indian took the failure far more philosophically than the white men as was natural the old fellow could quite well get on without \"eightee dolla\" could even get on without the tobacco tea sugar and matches represented by that sum but the travellers could not without dogs get to min ok it had been very well to feel set up because they had done the thing that everybody said was impossible it had been a costly victory yes it had come high \"and after all if we don t get dogs we re beaten \" oh beaten be blowed we ll toddle along somehow yes we ll toddle along if we get dogs and the boy knew the colonel was right they inquired about kaltag i reckon we d better push ahead while we can said the colonel so they left the camp that same evening intending to \"travel with the moon \" the settlement was barely out of sight when they met a squaw dragging a sled load of salmon here was luck \"and now we ll go back and get those two dogs \" as it was late and trading with the natives even for a fish was a matter of much time and patience they decided not to hurry the dog deal it was bound to take a good part of the evening at any rate well another night s resting up was welcome enough while the colonel was re establishing himself in the best cabin the boy cached the sled and then went prowling about as he fully intended he fell in with the leader that \"bully nigger dog \" his master not in sight nobody but some dirty children and the stranger there to see how the red dog in a moment of aberration dared offer insolence to the leader it all happened through the boy s producing a fish and presenting it on bended knee at a respectful distance the leader bestowed a contemptuous stare upon the stranger and pointedly turned his back the red dog came \"loping\" across the snow as he made for the fish the leader quietly headed him off pointed his sharp ears and just looked the other fellow out of countenance red said things under his breath as he turned away the more he thought the situation over the more he felt himself outraged he looked round over his shoulder there they still were the stranger holding out the fish the leader turning his back on it but telegraphing red at the same time not to dare it was more than dog flesh could bear red bounded back exploding in snarls no sound out of the leader whether this unnatural calm misled red he came up closer braced his forelegs and thrust his tawny muzzle almost into the other dog s face drew back his lips from all those shining wicked teeth and uttered a muffled hiss well it was magnificently done and it certainly looked as if the leader was going to have a troubled evening but he didn t seem to think so he \"fixed\" the red dog as one knowing the power of the master s eye to quell red s reply unimaginably bold was as the boy described it to the colonel \"to give the other fella the curse \" the boy was proud of red s pluck already looking upon him as his own but he jumped up from his ingratiating attitude still grasping the dried fish it would be a shame if that leader got chewed up and there was red every tooth bared gasping for gore and with each passing second seeming to throw a deeper damnation into his threat and to brace himself more firmly for the hurling of the final doom at that instant the stranger breathing quick and hard the elder children leaning forward some of the younger drawing back in terror if you ll believe it the leader blinked in a bored way and sat down on the snow a question only of last moments now poor brute and the bystanders held their breath but no red to be sure broke into the most awful demonstrations and nearly burst himself with fury but he backed away as though the spectacle offered by the leader were too disgusting for a decent dog to look at he went behind the shack and told the spotty one in no time they were back approaching the boy and the fish discreetly from behind such mean tactics roused the leader s ire he got up and flew at them they made it hot for him but still the leader seemed to be doing pretty well for himself when the old ingalik whom the boy had sent a child to summon hobbled up with a raw hide whip and laid it on with a practised hand separating the combatants kicking them impartially all round and speaking injurious words are your two hurt inquired the future owner anxiously the old fellow shook his head fur thick was the reassuring answer and once more the boy realised that these canine encounters though frequently ending in death often look and sound much more awful than they are as the leader feigned to be going home he made a dash in passing at the stranger s fish it was held tight and the pirate got off with only a fragment leader gave one swallow and looked back to see how the theft was being taken that surprising stranger simply stood there laughing and holding out the rest of a fine fat fish leader considered a moment looked the alien up and down came back all on guard for sudden rushes sly kicks and thwackings to pay him out but nothing of the kind the nigger dog said as plain as speech could make it you cheechalko person you look as if you re actually offering me that fish in good faith but i d be a fool to think so the stranger spoke low and quietly they talked for some time the owner of the two had shuffled off home again with spotty and red at his heels the leader came quite near looking almost docile but he snapped suddenly at the fish with an ugly gleam of eye and fang the boy nearly made the fatal mistake of jumping but he controlled the impulse and merely held tight to what was left of the salmon he stood quite still offering it with fair words the leader walked all round him and seemed with difficulty to recover from his surprise the boy felt that they were just coming to an understanding when up hurries peetka suspicious and out of sorts \"my dog \" he shouted \"no sell white man my dog huh ho oh no \" he kicked the leader viciously and drove him home abusing him all the way the wonder was that the wolfish creature didn t fly at his master s throat and finish him certainly the stranger s sympathies were all with the four legged one of the two brutes something about the leader the boy said sadly telling the colonel what had happened \"well sir i d give a hundred dollars to own that dog \" so would i was the dry rejoinder \"if i were a millionaire like you \" after supper their host who had been sent out to bring in the owner of red and spotty came back saying \"he come all come me tell you from below holy cross \" he laughed and shook his head in a well pantomimed incredulity representing popular opinion outside some of the bucks he added who had not gone far had got back with small game and dogs no dogs in the mountains hunt moose caribou the old ingalik came in followed by others \"some\" of the bucks there seemed no end to the throng opposite the white men the indians sat in a semicircle with the sole intent you might think of staring all night at the strangers yet they had brought in arctic hares and grouse and even a haunch of venison but they laid these things on the floor beside them and sat with grave unbroken silence till the strangers should declare themselves they had also brought or permitted to follow not only their wives and daughters but their children big and little behind the semicircle of men three or four deep were ranged the ranks of youth boys and girls from six to fourteen standing as silent as their elders but eager watchful carrying king salmon dried deer meat boot soles thongs for snow shoes rabbits grouse a little fellow of ten or eleven had brought in the red dog and was trying to reconcile him to his close quarters the owner of red and spotty sat with empty hands at the semicircle s farthest end but he was the capitalist of the village and held himself worthily yet not quite with the high and mighty unconcern of the owner of the leader peetka came in late bringing in the nigger dog against the nigger dog s will just to tantalise the white men with the sight of something they couldn t buy from the poor indian everybody made way for peetka and his dog except the other dog several people had to go to the assistance of the little boy to help him to hold red just as well perhaps said the colonel \"that we aren t likely to get all three \" oh if they worked together they d be all right answered the boy i ve noticed that before but the leader meanwhile was flatly refusing to stay in the same room with red he howled and snapped and raged so poor red was turned out and the little boy mourned loudly behind the children a row of squaws against the wall with and without babies strapped at their backs occasionally a young girl would push aside those in front of her craning and staring to take in the astonishing spectacle of the two white men who had come so far without dogs pulling a hand sled a greater distance than any indian had ever done if they could be believed anyhow these men with their sack of tea and magnificent bundle of matches above all with their tobacco they could buy out the town everything except peetka s dog the colonel and the boy opened the ball by renewing their joint offer of eighty dollars for red and spotty although this had been the old ingalik s own price it was discussed fully an hour by all present before the matter could be considered finally settled even then the colonel knew it was safest not to pay till just upon leaving but he made a little present of tobacco in token of satisfactory arrangement the old man s hands trembled excitedly as he pulled out his pipe and filled it the bucks round him and even a couple of the women at the back begged him for some he seemed to say \"do your own deal the strangers have plenty more \" by and by in spite of the limited english of the community certain facts stood out that peetka held the white man in avowed detestation that he was the leading spirit of the place that they had all been suffering from a tobacco famine and that much might be done by a judicious use of black jack and long green the colonel set forth the magnificent generosity of which he would be capable could he secure a good leader but peetka although he looked at his empty pipe with bitterness shook his head everybody in the village would profit the colonel went on everybody should have a present if peetka interrupted with a snarl and flung out low words of contemptuous refusal the leader waked from a brief nap cramped and uneasy and began to howl in sympathy his master stood up the better to deliver a brutal kick this seemed to help the leader to put up with cramp and confinement just as one great discomfort will help his betters to forget several little ones but the boy had risen with angry eyes very well he said impulsively if he and his pardner couldn t get a third dog two were very little good they would not stock fresh meat here in vain the colonel whispered admonition no sir they would wait till they got to the next village belly far said a young hunter placing ostentatiously in front his brace of grouse we re used to going belly far take all your game away and go home a sorrowful silence fell upon the room they sat for some time like that no one so much as moving till a voice said \"we want tobacco and a general murmur of assent arose peetka roused himself pulled out of his shirt a concave stone and a little woody looking knot the boy leaned forward to see what it was a piece of dried fungus the kind you sometimes see on the birches up here peetka was hammering a fragment of it into powder with his heavy clasp knife on the concave stone he swept the particles into his pipe and applied to one of the fish selling women for a match lit up and lounged back against the leader smiling disagreeably at the strangers a little laugh at their expense went round the room oh it wasn t easy to get ahead of peetka but even if he chose to pretend that he didn t want cheechalko tobacco it was very serious it was desperate to see all that black jack going on to the next village several of the hitherto silent bucks remonstrated with peetka even one of the women dared raise her voice she had not been able to go for fish where was her tobacco and tea peetka burst into voluble defence of his position casting occasional looks of disdain upon the strangers he addressed most of his remarks to the owner of red and spotty although the colonel could not understand a word he saw the moment approaching when that person would go back on his bargain with uncommon pleasure he could have throttled peetka the boy to create a diversion had begun talking to a young hunter in the front row about the long trail and seeing that several others craned and listened he spoke louder more slowly dropping out all unnecessary or unusual words very soon he had gained an audience and peetka had lost one as the stranger went on describing their experiences the whole room listened with an attentiveness that would have been flattering had it been less strongly dashed with unbelief from beyond anvik they had come like that with no dogs what from below koserefsky not really peetka grunted and shook his head did they think the ingaliks were children without dogs that journey was impossible low whispers and gruff exclamations filled the room white men were great liars they pretended that in their country the bacon had legs and could run about and one had been heard to say he had travelled in a thing like a steamboat only it could go without water under it ran over the dry land on strips of iron ran quicker than any steamer oh they were awful liars but these two who pretended they d dragged a sled all the way from holy cross they were the biggest liars of all just let them tell that yarn to unookuk they all laughed at this and the name ran round the room who is unookuk \" him guide him know where is him asked the boy him sick but there was whispering and consultation this was evidently a case for the expert two boys ran out and the native talk went on unintelligible save for the fact that it centred round unookuk in a few minutes the boys came back with a tall fine looking native about sixty years old walking lame and leaning on a stick the semicircle opened to admit him he limped over to the strangers and stood looking at them gravely modestly but with careful scrutiny the boy held out his hand how do you do how do you do echoed the new comer and he also shook hands with the colonel before he sat down are you unookuk yes how far you come peetka said something rude before the strangers had time to answer and all the room went into titters but unookuk listened with dignity while the colonel repeated briefly the story already told plainly it stumped unookuk come from anvik he repeated yes stayed with mr benham oh benham the trader s familiar name ran round the room with obvious effect \"it is good to have a c agent for friend said unookuk guardedly everybody know benham \" he is not a c agent much longer volunteered the boy that so no he will go on his own after the new agent gets in this spring it is true answered unookuk gravely for the first time a little impressed for this news was not yet common property still they could have heard it from some passer with a dog team the boy spoke of holy cross and unookuk s grave unbelief was painted on every feature it was good you get to holy cross before the big storm he said with a faint smile of tolerance for the white man s tall story but peetka laughed aloud what good english you speak said the boy determined to make friends with the most intelligent appearing native he had seen me i am kurilla said unookuk with a quiet magnificence then seeing no electric recognition of the name he added \"you savvy kurilla \" the colonel with much regret admitted that he did not but i am dall s guide kurilla oh dall s guide are you said the boy without a glimmer of who dall was or for what or to what he was \"guided \" \"well kurilla we re pleased and proud to meet you adding with some presence of mind and how s dall \" it is long i have not hear we both old now i hurt my knee on the ice when i come down from nulato for caribou why do you have two names unookuk nulato name my father big nulato sham n him killed mother killed everybody killed in koyukuk massacre they forget kill me me kid russians find unookuk in big wood russians give food i stay with russians them call unookuk kurilla dall call unookuk kurilla dall dall said the colonel to the boy \"was that the name of the explorer fella \" fortunately the boy was saved from need to answer first white man go down yukon to the sea said kurilla with pride me dall s guide oh wrote a book didn t he name s familiar somehow said the colonel kurilla bore him out mr dall great man thirty year he first come up here with survey people make big overland tel ee grab of course i ve heard about that the colonel turned to the boy \"it was just before the russians sold out and when a lot of exploring and surveying and pole planting was done here and in siberia the atlantic cable was laid and knocked the overland scheme sky high \" kurilla gravely verified these facts and me dall s chief guide me with dall when he make portage from unalaklik to kaltag he see the yukon first time he run down to be first on the ice dall and the coast natives stare like so kurilla made a wild eyed ludicrous face \"and they say it is not a river it is another sea \" no wonder i hear it s ten miles wide up by the flats and even a little below where we wintered at ikogimeut it s four miles across from bank to bank kurilla looked at the colonel with dignified reproach why did he go on lying about his journey like that to an expert even at holy cross the boy began but kurilla struck in when you there oh about three weeks ago peetka made remarks in ingalik father macmanus him all right asked kurilla politely cloaking his cross examination macmanus do you mean wills or the superior father brachet oh yes macmanus at tanana he spoke as though inadvertently he had confused the names as the strangers gave him the winter s news from holy cross his wonder and astonishment grew presently \"do you know my friend nicholas of pymeut \" asked the boy kurilla took his empty pipe out of his mouth and smiled in broad surprise \"nicholas \" repeated several others it was plain the pymeut pilot enjoyed a wide repute the boy spoke of the famine and ol chief s illness it is true said unookuk gravely and turning he added something in ingalik to the company peetka answered back as surly as ever but the boy went on telling how the shaman had cured ol chief and that turned out to be a surprisingly popular story peetka wouldn t interrupt it even to curse the leader for getting up and stretching himself when the dog feeling that for some reason discipline was relaxed dared to leave his cramped quarters and come out into the little open space between the white men and the close packed assembly the boy forced himself to go straight on with his story as if he had not observed the liberty the leader was taking when after standing there an instant the dog came over and threw himself down at the stranger s feet as if publicly adopting him the white story teller dared not meet peetka s eye he was privately most uneasy at the nigger dog s tactless move and he hurried on about how brother paul caught the sham n and about the penitential journey told how long before that early in the fall nicholas had got lost making the portage from st michael s and how the white camp had saved him from starvation how in turn the pymeuts had pulled the speaker out of a blow hole what tremendous friends the pymeuts were with these particular very good sort of white men here he seemed to allow by implication for peetka s prejudice there were two kinds of pale face strangers and on an impulse he drew out muckluck s medal he would have them to know so highly were these present specimens of the doubtful race regarded by the pymeuts such friends were they that nicholas sister had given him this for an offering to yukon inua that the great spirit might help them on their way he owned himself wrong to have delayed this sacrifice he must to morrow throw it into the first blow hole he came to unless indeed his eye caught kurilla s with the help of his stick the old guide pulled his big body up on his one stout leg hobbled nearer and gravely eyed muckluck s offering as it swung to and fro on its walrus string over the leader s head the boy quite conscious of some subtle change in the hitherto immobile face of the indian laid the token in his hand standing there in the centre of the semicircle between the assembly and the dog kurilla turned the great katharine s medal over examining it closely every eye in the room upon him when he lifted his head there was a rustle of expectation and a craning forward it is the same kurilla spoke slowly like one half in a dream \"when i go down river thirty winter back with the great dall he try buy this off nicholas s mother she wear it on string red russian beads oh it is a thing to remember \" he nodded his grey head significantly but he went on with the bare evidence \"when john j healy make last trip down this fall nicholas pilot you savvy they let him take his sister holy cross to pymeut i see she wear this round neck \" the weight of the medal carried the raw hide necklace slipping through his fingers slowly now with even impulse the silver disc swung right swung left like the pendulum of a clock even the nigger dog seemed hypnotised following the dim shine of the tarnished token i say nicholas s sister it is thirty winters i see that silver picture first i give you two dolla for him she say no i say gi fi dolla no i sit and think far back thirty winters back i gi ten dolla i say she say i no sell no not for a hunner but she give it him for to make yukon inua to let him go safe hein savvy and lapsing into ingalik he endorsed this credential not to be denied it is true he wound up in english the \"autocratrix russorum\" was solemnly handed back \"you have make a brave journey it is i who unnerstan i too when i am young i go with dall on the long trail we had dogs \" all the while from all about the leader s owner and out of every corner of the crowded room had come a spirited punctuation of kurilla s speech nods and grunts \"yes perhaps these white men deserved dogs even peetka s \" kurilla limped back to his place but turned to the ingaliks before he sat down and bending painfully over his stick \"not kurilla he said as though speaking of one absent not dall make so great journey no dogs kurilla best guide in yukon forty year kurilla say must have dogs men like that \" he limped back again and solemnly offered his hand to each of the travellers in turn \"shake \" says he then as though fascinated by the silver picture he dropped down by the boy staring absently at the great katharine s effigy the general murmur was arrested by a movement from peetka he took his pipe out of his mouth and says he handsomely no liars sell dog adding with regretful eye on the apostate leader \"him bully dog \" and that was how the tobacco famine ended and how the white men got their team chapter xv the esquimaux horse \"plus je connais les hommes plus j aime les chiens \" it doesn t look hard to drive a dog team but just you try it in moments of passion the first few days after their acquisition the colonel and the boy wondered why they had complicated a sufficiently difficult journey by adding to other cares a load of fish and three fiends think how well they went for peetka oh yes part o their cussedness they know we re green hands and they mean to make it lively well they did they sat on their haunches in the snow and grinned at the whip crackings and futile \"mush mush \" of the colonel they snapped at the boy and made sharp turns tying him up in the traces and tumbling him into the snow they howled all night long except during a blessed interval of quiet while they ate their seal skin harness but man is the wiliest of the animals and the one who profits by experience in the end the boy became a capital driver the dogs came to know he \"meant business and settled into submission nig as he called the bully dog for short turned out the best leader in the yukon \" they were much nearer kaltag than they had realised arriving after only two hours struggle with the dogs at the big indian village on the left bank of the river but their first appearance here was clouded by nig s proposal to slay all the dogs in sight he was no sooner unharnessed than he undertook the congenial job it looked for a few minutes as if peetka s bully dog would chew up the entire canine population and then lie down and die of his own wounds but the kaltags understood the genus siwash better than the white man and took the tumult calmly it turned out that nig was not so much bloodthirsty as bloody proud one of those high souls for ever concerned about supremacy his first social act on catching sight of his fellow was to howl defiance at him and even after they have fought it out and come to some sort of understanding the first happy thought of your born leader on awakening is to proclaim himself boss of the camp no sooner has he published this conviction of high calling than he is set upon by the others punishes them soundly or is himself vanquished and driven off whereupon he sits on his haunches in the snow and with his pointed nose turned skyward howls uninterruptedly for an hour or two when all is forgiven and forgotten till the next time order being restored the travellers got new harness for the dogs new boots for themselves and set out for the white trading post thirty miles above here having at last come into the region of settlements they agreed never again to overtax the dogs they \"travelled light\" out of nulato towards the koyukuk the dogs simply flew over those last miles it was glorious going on a trail like glass they had broken the back of the journey now and could well afford they thought to halt an hour or two on the island at the junction of the two great rivers stake out a trading post and treat themselves to town lots why town lots in heaven s name when they were bound for min ok and after that the klondyke hundreds of miles away well partly out of mere gaiety of heart and partly the colonel would have told you gravely that in this country you never know when you have a good thing they had left the one white layman at nulato seething with excitement over an indian s report of still another rich strike up yonder on the koyukuk and this point where they were solemnly staking out a new post the nulato agent had said was \"dead sure to be a great centre \" that almost unknown region bordering the great tributary of the yukon haunt of the fiercest of all the indians of the north was to be finally conquered by the white man it had been left practically unexplored ever since the days when the bloodthirsty koyukons came down out of their fastnesses and perpetrated the great nulato massacre doing to death with ghastly barbarity every man woman and child at the post russian or indian except kurilla not sparing the unlucky captain barnard or his english escort newly arrived here in their search for the lost sir john franklin but the tables were turned now and the white man was on the trail of the indian while the colonel and the boy were staking out this future stronghold of trade and civilisation it came on to snow but \"can t last this time o year the colonel consoled himself and thanked god the big unending snows are over for this season \" so they pushed on but the colonel seemed to have thanked god prematurely down the snow drifted soft sticky unending the evening was cloudy and the snow increased the dimness overhead as well as the heaviness under foot they never knew just where it was in the hours between dusk and dark that they lost the trail the boy believed it was at a certain steep incline that nig did his best to rush down i thought he was at his tricks said the boy ruefully some hours after \"i believe i m an ass and nig is a gentleman and a scholar he knew perfectly what he was about \" reckon we ll camp pardner reckon we might as well after unharnessing the dogs the boy stood an instant looking enviously at them as he thawed out his stiff hands under his parki exhausted and smoking hot the dogs had curled down in the snow as contented looking as though on a hearth rug before a fire sheltering their sharp noses with their tails wish i had a tail to shelter my face said the boy as if a tail were the one thing lacking to complete his bliss you don t need any shelter now answered the colonel your face is gettin well and he stopped suddenly carried back to those black days when he had vainly urged a face guard he unpacked their few possessions and watched the boy take the axe and go off for wood stopping on his way tired as he was to pull nig s pointed ears the odd thing about the boy was that it was only with these indian curs nig in particular who wasn t the boy s dog at all only with these brute beasts had he seemed to recover something of that buoyancy and ridiculous youngness that had first drawn the colonel to him on the voyage up from frisco it was also clear that if the boy now drew away from his pardner ever so little by so much did he draw nearer to the dogs he might be too tired to answer the colonel he was seldom too tired to talk nonsense to nig never too tired to say \"well old boy or even well pardner to the dumb brute it was perhaps this that the colonel disliked most of all whether the u s agent at nulato was justified or not in saying all the region hereabouts was populous in the summer with indian camps the native winter settlements the half buried ighloo or the rude log hut where for a little tea tobacco or sugar you could get as much fish as you could carry these welcome if malodorous places seemed since they lost the trail to have vanished off the face of the earth no question of the men sharing the dogs fish but of the dogs sharing the men s bacon and meal that night the meagre supper was more meagre still that the horses\" might have something too the next afternoon it stopped snowing and cleared intensely cold and that was the evening the boy nearly cried for joy when lifting up his eyes he saw a good way off perched on the river bank the huts and high caches of an indian village etched black against a wintry sunset a fine picture in any eye but meaning more than beauty to the driver of hungry dogs fish nig called out the boy to his leader \"you hear me you nig fish old fellow now look at that colonel you tell me that indian dog doesn t understand english i tell you what we had a mean time with these dogs just at first but that was only because we didn t understand one another \" the colonel preserved a reticent air you ll come to my way of thinking yet the indian dog he s a daisy glad you think so the colonel with some display of temper had given up trying to drive the team only half an hour before and was still rather sore about it when you get to understand him persisted the boy \"he s the most marvellous little horse ever hitched in harness he pulls pulls pulls all day long in any kind o weather \" yes pulls you off your legs or pulls you the way you don t want to go oh that s when you rile him he s just like any other american gentleman he s got his feelin s ain t you got feelin s nig huh rather i tell you what colonel many a time when i m pretty well beat and ready to snap at anybody i ve looked at nig peggin away like a little man on a rotten trail with a blizzard in his eyes and it s just made me sick after that to hear myself grumblin yes sir the indian dog is an example to any white man on the trail the boy seemed not to relinquish the hope of stirring the tired colonel to enthusiasm don t you like the way after the worst sort of day when you stop he just drops down in the snow and rolls about a little to rest his muscles and then lies there as patient as anything till you are ready to unharness him and feed him and if you don t hurry up he saves you the trouble of unharnessing by eating the traces and things humph so would you if that village weren t in sight if you were sure the harness wouldn t stick in your gizzard and think of what a dog gets to reward him for his plucky day one dried salmon or a little meal soup when he s off on a holiday like this works without a let up and keeps in good flesh on one fish a day doesn t even get anything to drink eats a little snow after dinner digs his bed and sleeps in a drift till morning when he doesn t howl all night oh that s when he meets his friends and they talk about old times before they came down in the world hey yes when they were wolves and made us run instead of our making them make any fellow howl instead of carrying our food about we used to carry theirs and run hard to keep from giving it up too nig s at it again said the colonel \"give us your whip \" no said the boy \"i begin to see now why he stops and goes for red like that hah spot s gettin it too this time they haven t been pullin properly you just notice if they aren t doin their share nig ll turn to every time and give em hail columbia you ll see when he s freshened em up a bit we ll have em on a dead run \" the boy laughed and cracked his whip they ve got keen noses i don t smell the village this time come on nig spot s had enough he s sorry good and plenty cheer up spot fish old man you hear me talkin to you red fish caches full of it whoop and down they rushed pell mell men and dogs tearing along like mad across the frozen river and never slowing till it came to the stiff pull up the opposite bank funny i don t hear any dogs panted the boy they came out upon a place silent as the dead a big deserted village emptied by the plague or maybe only by the winter caches emptied too not a salmon not a pike not a lusk not even a whitefish left behind it was a bitter blow they didn t say anything it was too bad to talk about the colonel made the fire and fried a little bacon and made some mush that was their dinner the bacon rinds were boiled in the mush pot with a great deal of snow and a little meal and the \"soup\" so concocted was set out to cool for the dogs they were afraid to sleep in one of the cabins it might be plague infected the indians had cut all the spruce for a wide radius round about no boughs to make a bed they hoisted some tent poles up into one of the empty caches laid them side by side and on this bed dry if hard they found oblivion the next morning a thin powdery snow was driving about had they lost their way in the calendar as well as on the trail and was it december instead of the th of march the colonel sat on the packed sled undoing with stiff fingers the twisted frozen rope he knew the axe that he used the night before on the little end of bacon was lying pressed into the snow under one runner but that was the last thing to go on the pack before the lashing and it wouldn t get lost pinned down under the sled nig caught sight of it and came over with a cheerful air of interest sniffed bacon on the steel and it occurred to him it would be a good plan to lick it a bitter howling broke the stillness the boy came tearing up with a look that lifted the colonel off the sled and there was nig trying to get away from the axe head his tongue frozen fast to the steel and pulled horribly long out of his mouth like a little pink rope the boy had fallen upon the agonized beast and forced him down close to the steel holding him there between his knees he pulled off his outer mits and with hands and breath warmed the surface of the axe speaking now and then to the dog who howled wretchedly but seemed to understand something was being done for him since he gave up struggling when at last the boy got him free the little horse pressed against his friend s legs with a strange new shuddering noise very pitiful to hear the boy blinking hard said \"yes old man i know that was a mean breakfast and he patted the shaggy chest nig bent his proud head and licked the rescuing hand with his bleeding tongue an you say that dog hasn t got feelin s they hitched the team and pushed on in the absence of a trail the best they could do was to keep to the river ice by and bye can you see the river bank i m not sure said the boy i thought you were going it blind i believe i d better let nig have his head said the boy stopping he s the dandy trail finder nig old man i takes off my hat to you they pushed ahead till the half famished dogs gave out they camped under the lee of the propped sled and slept the sleep of exhaustion the next morning dawned clear and warm the colonel managed to get a little wood and started a fire there were a few spoonfuls of meal in the bottom of the bag and a little end of bacon mostly rind the sort of soup the dogs had had yesterday was good enough for men to day the hot and watery brew gave them strength enough to strike camp and move on the elder man began to say to himself that he would sell his life dearly he looked at the dogs a good deal and then would look at the boy but he could never catch his eye at last \"they say you know that men in our fix have sometimes had to sacrifice a dog \" ugh the boy s face expressed nausea at the thought yes it is pretty revolting we could never do it n no said the colonel the three little esquimaux horses were not only very hungry their feet were in a bad condition and were bleeding the boy had shut his eyes at first at the sight of their red tracks in the snow he hardly noticed them now an hour or so later \"better men than we says the colonel significantly have had to put their feelings in their pockets \" as if he found the observation distinctly discouraging nig at this moment sat down in the melting snow and no amount of \"mushing\" moved him let s give him half an hour s rest colonel valuable beast you know altogether best team on the river said the boy as if to show that his suggestion was not inspired by mere pity for the bleeding dogs \"and you look rather faded yourself colonel sit down and rest \" nothing more was said for a full half hour till the colonel taking off his fur hat and wiping his beaded forehead on the back of his hand remarked \"think of the siege of paris \" eh what the boy stared as if afraid his partner s brain had given way when the horses gave out they had to eat dogs cats rats even think of it rats the french are a dirty lot let s mush colonel i m as fit as a fiddle the boy got up and called the dogs in ten minutes they were following the blind trail again but the sled kept clogging sticking fast and breaking down after a desperate bout of ineffectual pulling the dogs with one mind stopped again and lay down in their bloody tracks the men stood silent for a moment then the colonel remarked red is the least valuable a long pause \"but nig s feet are in the worst condition that dog won t travel a mile further well added the colonel after a bit as the boy stood speechless studying the team what do you say \" me he looked up like a man who has been dreaming and is just awake oh i should say our friend nig here has had to stand more than his share of the racket poor old nig said the colonel with a somewhat guilty air \"look here what do you say to seeing whether they can go if we help em with that load \" good for you colonel said the boy with confidence wonderfully restored \"i was just thinking the same \" they unlashed the pack and the colonel wanted to make two bundles of the bedding and things but whether the boy really thought the colonel was giving out or whether down in some corner of his mind he recognised the fact that if the colonel were not galled by this extra burden he might feel his hunger less and so be less prone to thoughts of poor nig in the pot however it was he said the bundle was his business for the first hour so the colonel did the driving and the boy tramped on ahead breaking trail with thirty five pounds on his back and he didn t give it up either though he admitted long after it was the toughest time he had ever put in in all his life haven t you had about enough of this the colonel sang out at dusk pretty nearly said the boy in a rather weak voice he flung off the pack and sat on it get up says the colonel \"give us the sleepin bag \" when it was undone the norfolk jacket dropped out he rolled it up against the sled flung himself down and heavily dropped his head on the rough pillow but he sprang up what yes by the lord he thrust his hand into the capacious pocket of the jacket and pulled out some broken ship s biscuit \"hard tack by the living jingo \" he was up had a few sticks alight and the kettle on and was melting snow to pour on the broken biscuit \"it swells you know like thunder \" the boy was still sitting on the bundle of \"trade\" tea and tobacco he seemed not to hear he seemed not to see the colonel shakily hovering about the fire pushing aside the green wood and adding a few sticks of dry there was a mist before the colonel s eyes reaching after a bit of seasoned spruce he stumbled and unconsciously set his foot on nig s bleeding paw the dog let out a yell and flew at him the colonel fell back with an oath picked up a stick and laid it on the boy was on his feet in a flash here stop that he jumped in between the infuriated man and the infuriated dog stand back roared the colonel it was your fault you trod stand back damn you or you ll get hurt the stick would have fallen on the boy he dodged it calling excitedly \"come here nig here \" he s my dog and i ll lamm him if i like you the colonel couldn t see just where the boy and the culprit were stumbling a few paces away from the glare of the fire he called out \"i ll kill that brute if he snaps at me again \" oh yes the boy s voice rang passionately out of the gloom \"i know you want him killed \" the colonel sat down heavily on the rolled up bag presently the bubbling of boiling snow water roused him he got up divided the biscuit and poured the hot water over the fragments then he sat down again and waited for them to \"swell like thunder \" he couldn t see where a little way up the hillside the boy sat on a fallen tree with nig s head under his arm the boy felt pretty low in his mind he sat crouched together with his head sunk almost to his knees it was a lonely kind of a world after all doing your level best didn t seem to get you any forrader what was the use he started something warm caressing touched his cold face just under one eye nig s tongue good old nig you feel lonesome too he gathered the rough beast up closer to him just then the colonel called \"nig \" sh sh lie quiet whispered the boy nig nig good old boy stay here he doesn t mean well by you sh quiet quiet i say nig and the treacherous colonel gave the peculiar whistle both men used to call the dogs to supper the dog struggled to get away the boy s stiff fingers lost their grip and \"the best leader in the yukon\" was running down the bank as hard as he could pelt to the camp fire to the cooking pot the boy got up and floundered away in the opposite direction he must get out of hearing he toiled on listening for the expected gunshot hearing it too and the yawp of a wounded dog in spite of a mitten clapped at each ear that s the kind of world it is do your level best drag other fellas packs hundreds o miles over the ice with a hungry belly and bloody feet and then poor old nig cause you re lame poor old nig with a tightened throat and hot water in his eyes he kept on repeating the dog s name as he stumbled forward in the snow \"nev mind old boy it s a lonely kind o world and the right trail s hard to find \" suddenly he stood still his stumbling feet were on a track he had reached the dip in the saddle back of the hill and yes this was the right trail for down on the other side below him were faint lights huts an indian village with fish and food for everybody and nig nig was being the boy turned as if a hurricane had struck him and tore back down the incline stumbling floundering in the snow calling hoarsely colonel colonel don t do it there s a village here colonel nig colonel don t do it he dashed into the circle of firelight and beheld nig standing with a bandaged paw placidly eating softened biscuit out of the family frying pan it was short work getting down to the village they had one king salmon and two white fish from the first indian they saw who wanted hootch for them and got only tabak in the biggest of the huts nearly full of men women and children coughing sickly looking dejected the natives made room for the strangers when the white men had supped they handed over the remains of their meal as is expected to the head of the house this and a few matches or a little tobacco on parting is all he looks for in return for shelter room for beds on the floor snow water laboriously melted use of the fire and as much wood as they like to burn even if it is a barren place and fuel is the precious far travelled \"drift \" it is curious to see how soon travellers get past that first cheeckalko feeling that it is a little \"nervy as the boy had said to walk into another man s house uninvited an absolute stranger and take possession of everything you want without so much as by your leave \" you soon learn it is the siwash custom footnote siwash corruption of french canadian sauvage applied all over the north to the natives their possessions and their customs nothing would have seemed stranger now or more inhuman than the civilized point of view the indians trailed out one by one all except the old buck to whom the hut belonged he hung about for a bit till he was satisfied the travellers had no hootch not even a little for the head of the house and yet they seemed to be fairly decent fellows then he rolls up his blankets for there is a premium on sleeping space and goes out with never a notion that he is doing more than any man would anywhere in the world to find a place in some neighbour s hut to pass the night he leaves the two strangers as indian hospitality ordains to the warmest places in the best hut with two young squaws one old one and five children all sleeping together on the floor as a matter of course the colonel and the boy had flung themselves down on top of their sleeping bag fed and warmed and comforted only the old squaw was still up she had been looking over the travellers boots and \"mitts and now without a word or even a look being exchanged upon the subject she sat there in the corner by the dim seal oil light sewing on new thongs patching up holes and making the strange men tidy men she had never seen before and would never see again and this no tribute to the colonel s generosity or the youth and friendly manners of the boy they knew the old squaw would have done just the same had the mucklucks and the mitts belonged to the tramp of the yukon with nothing to barter and not a cent in his pocket this again is a siwash custom the old squaw coughed and wiped her eyes the children coughed in their sleep the dogs outside were howling like human beings put to torture but the sound no longer had power to freeze the blood of the trail men the colonel merely damned them the boy lifted his head and listened for nig s note the battle raged nearer a great scampering went by the tent nig \" a scuffling and snuffing round the bottom of the tent the boy on a sudden impulse reached out and lifted the flap got your bandage on come here nig brisked in with the air of one having very little time to waste lord i should think you d be glad to lie down i am let s see your paw here come over to the light he stepped very carefully over the feet of the other inhabitants till he reached the old woman s corner nig following calmly walked on prostrate bodies till he reached his friend now your paw pardner f ith bad ain t it he appealed to the toothless squaw her best friend could not have said her wizened regard was exactly sympathetic but it was attentive she seemed intelligent as well as kind look here whispered the boy \"let that muckluck string o mine alone \" he drew it away and dropped it between his knees \"haven t you got something or other to make some shoes for nig hein \" he pantomimed but she only stared \"like this \" he pulled out his knife and cut off the end of one leg of his \"shaps and gathered it gently round nig s nearest foot little dog boots see give you some bully tabak if you ll do that for nig hein \" she nodded at last and made a queer wheezy sound whether friendly laughing or pure scorn the boy wasn t sure but she set about the task come long nig he whispered \"you just see if i don t shoe my little horse \" and he sneaked back to bed comfortable in the assurance that the colonel was asleep nig came walking after his friend straight over people s heads one of the children sat up and whimpered the colonel growled sleepily you black devil admonished the boy under his breath \"look what you re about come here sir \" he pushed the devil down between the sleeping bag and the nearest baby the colonel gave a distinct grunt of disapproval and then \"keepin that brute in here \" he s a lot cleaner than our two legged friends said the boy sharply as if answering an insult right said the colonel with conviction his pardner was instantly mollified \"if you wake another baby you ll get a lickin he said genially to the dog and then he stretched out his feet till they reached nig s back and a feeling of great comfort came over the boy say colonel he yawned luxuriously did you know that a to night when nig flared up did you know you d trodden on his paw \" didn t know it till you told me growled the colonel i thought you didn t makes a difference doesn t it you needn t think says the colonel a little defiantly \"that i ve weakened on the main point just because i choose to give nig a few cracker crumbs if it s a question between a man s life and a dog s life only a sentimental fool would hesitate \" i m not talking about that we can get fish now what i m pointin out is that nig didn t fly at you for nothin he s got a devil of a temper that dog it s just like nicholas of pymeut said the boy sat up eager in his advocacy and earnest as a judge \"nicholas of pymeut said you treat a siwash like a heathen and he ll show you what a hell of a heathen he can be \" oh go to sleep i m goin colonel chapter xvi min ok for whatever may come to pass it lies with me to have it serve me epictetus the indians guided them back to the trail the colonel and the boy made good speed to novikakat laid in supplies at korkorines heard the first doubtful account of min ok at tanana and pushed on past camps stoneman and woodworth where the great klondyke expeditions lay fast in the ice along the white strip of the narrowing river pent in now between mountains black with scant subarctic timber or gray with fantastic weather worn rock on and on till they reached the bluffs of the lower ramparts here at last between the ranks of the many gabled heights big min ok creek meets father yukon just below the junction perched jauntily on a long terrace up above the frozen riverbed high and dry and out of the coming trouble when river and creek should wake here was the long log built mining town min ok or rampart for the name was still undetermined in the spring of it was a great moment shake pardner said the boy the colonel and he grasped hands only towering good spirits prevented their being haughty for they felt like conquerors and cared not a jot that they looked like gaol birds it was two o clock in the morning the gold nugget saloon was flaring with light and a pianola was perforating a tune the travellers pushed open a frosted door and looked into a long low smoke veiled room hung with many kerosene lamps and heated by a great red hot iron stove hello said a middle aged man in mackinaws smoking near the door end of the bar hello is blandford keith here there are some letters for him say boys the man in mackinaws shouted above the pianola \"windy jim s got in with the mail \" the miners lounging at the bar and sitting at the faro tables looked up laughing and seeing the strangers through the smoke haze stopped laughing to stare down from dawson asked the bartender hurrying forward a magnificent creature in a check waistcoat shirt sleeves four in hand tie and a diamond pin no t other way about up from the lower river oh may west or muckluck crew anyhow i guess you got a thirst on you said the man in the mackinaws \"come and licker up \" the bartender mixed the drinks in style shooting the liquor from a height into the small gin sling glasses with the dexterity that had made him famous when their tired eyes had got accustomed to the mingled smoke and glare the travellers could see that in the space beyond the card tables in those back regions where the pianola reigned there were several couples twirling about the clumsily dressed miners pirouetting with an astonishing lightness on their moccasined feet and women white women they stopped dancing and came forward to see the new arrivals the mackinaw man was congratulating the colonel on \"gettin back to civilization \" see that plate glass mirror he pointed behind the bar below the moose antlers \"see them ladies you ve got to a place where you can rake in the dust all day and dance all night and go buckin the tiger between whiles great place min ok here s luck \" he took up the last of the gin slings set in a row before the party have you got some property here asked the boy the man without putting down his glass simply closed one eye over the rim we ve heard some bad accounts of these diggin s said the colonel i ain t sayin there s millions for every body you ve got to get the inside track see that feller talkin to the girl billy nebrasky tipped him the wink in time to git the inside track just before the fall stampede up the gulch which gulch he only motioned with his head \"through havin that tip he got there in time to stake number three below discovery he s had to hang up drinks all winter but he s a millionaire all right he s got a hundred thousand dollars in sight only waitin for runnin water to wash it out \" then there is gold about here there is gold say maudie he remarked in a humourous half aside to the young woman who was passing with no thumb jack \"this fellow wants to know if there is gold here \" she laughed \"guess he ain t been here long \" now it is not to be denied that this rejoinder was susceptible of more than one interpretation but the mackinaw man seemed satisfied so much so that he offered maudie the second gin sling which the colonel had ordered \"all round \" she eyed the strangers over the glass on the hand that held it a fine diamond sparkled you would say she was twenty six but you wouldn t have been sure she had seemed at least that at a distance now she looked rather younger the face wore an impudent look yet it was delicate too her skin showed very white and fine under the dabs of rouge the blueness was not yet faded out of her restless eyes min ok s all right no josh about that she said setting down her glass then to the boy \"have a dance \" not much he replied rather roughly and turned away to talk about the diggin s to two men on the other side maudie laid her hand on the colonel s arm and the diamond twitched the light \" you will she said well you see ma am\" the colonel s smile was charming in spite of his wild beard \"we ve done such a lot o dancin lately done nothin else for forty days and after seven hundred miles of it we re just a trifle tired ma am \" she laughed good naturedly pity you re tired said the mackinaw man \"there s a pretty good thing goin just now but it won t be goin long \" the boy turned his head round again with reviving interest in his own group look here si maudie was saying \"if you want to let a lay on your new claim to anybody mind it s got to be me \" but the mackinaw man was glancing speculatively over at another group in haste to forestall desertion the boy inquired do you know of anything good that isn t staked yet well mebbe i don t and mebbe i do then as if to prove that he wasn t overanxious to pursue the subject \"say maudie ain t that french charlie over there \" maudie put her small nose in the air ain t you made it up with charlie yet no i ain t then we ll have another drink all round while he was untying the drawstring of his gold sack maudie said half aside but whether to the colonel or the boy neither could tell might do worse than keep your eye on si mcginty she nodded briskly at the violet checks on the mackinaw back \"si s got a cinch up there on glory hallelujah and nobody s on to it yet \" the pianola picked out a polka the man si mcginty had called french charlie came up behind the girl and said something she shook her head turned on her heel and began circling about in the narrow space till she found another partner french charlie scowling after them as they whirled away between the faro tables back into the smoke and music at the rear mcginty was watching jimmie the man at the gold scales pinch up some of the excess dust in the scale pan and toss it back into the brass blower where did that gold come from asked the colonel off a claim o mine and he lapsed into silence you are always told these fellows are so anxious to rope in strangers this man didn t seem to be it made him very interesting the boy acted strictly on the woman s hint and kept an eye on the person who had a sure thing up on glory hallelujah but when the lucky man next opened his mouth it was to say why there s butts down from circle city butts repeated the boy with little affectation of interest yep wonder what the son of a gun is after here but he spoke genially even with respect who s butts butts ah well a butts is the smartest fellow with his fingers in all laska and mcginty showed his big yellow teeth in an appreciative smile smart at washin gold out smarter at pickin it out the bartender joined in si s laugh as that gentleman repeated \"yes sir handiest feller with his fingers i ever seen \" what does he do with his fingers asked the boy with impatient suspicion well he don t dare do much with em up here tain t popular what ain t butts s little game but lord he is good at it butts had been introduced as a stalking horse but there was no doubt about si s admiration of his \"handiness \" \"butts is wasted up here he sighed there s some chance for a murderer in alaska but a thief s a goner \" oh well you were sayin that gold o yours came from poor old butts bright feller too how far off is your i tell you sir butts is brains to his boots course you know jack mcquestion no but i d like to hear a little about your y don know jack mcquestion well sir jack s the biggest man in the yukon why he built fort reliance six miles below the mouth of the klondyke in he discovered gold on the stewart in and established a post there everybody knows jack mcquestion an quickly as he saw he was about to be interrupted \"you heard about that swell watch we all clubbed together and give him no well sir there ain t an eleganter watch in the world is there \" guess not said the bartender repeater you know got twenty seven di mon s in the case one of em s this size he presented the end of a gnarled and muscular thumb and inside the case is all wrote in a lot of soft sawder but jack ain t got any thing he cares for so much you can see he s always tickled to death when anybody asks him the time but do you think he ever lets that watch out n his own hands not much let s anybody look at it and keeps a holt o the stem winder well sir we was all in a saloon up at circle and that feller over there butts he bet me fifty dollars that he d git mcquestion s watch away from him before he left the saloon an it was late mcquestion was thinkin a ready about goin home to that squaw wife that keeps him so straight well sir butts went over and began to gas about outfittin and mcquestion answers and figures up the estimates on the counter and by gawd in less n quarter of an hour butts just standin there and listenin as you d think he d got that di mon watch off n the chain an had it in his pocket i knew he done it though i ain t exactly seen how he done it the others who were in the game they swore he hadn t got it yet but by gawd butts says he ll think over mcquestion s terms and wonders what time it is he takes that di mon watch out of his pocket glances at it and goes off smooth as cream sayin good night then he come a grinnin over to us jest you go an ask the father o the yukon pioneers what time it is will yer an i done it well sir when he put his hand in his pocket by gawd i wish y could a saw mcquestion s face yes sir butts is brains to his boots how far out are the diggin s what diggin s yours oh a my gulch ain t fur there was a noise about the door someone bustled in with a torrent of talk and the pianola was drowned in a pandemonium of shouts and laughter windy jim s reely got back everybody crowded forward maudie was at the colonel s elbow explaining that the little yellow bearded man with the red nose was the letter carrier he had made a contract early in the winter to go to dawson and bring down the mail for min ok his agreement was to make the round trip and be back by the middle of february since early march the standing gag in the camp had been \"well windy jim got in last night \" the mild jest had grown stale and the denizens of min ok had given up the hope of ever laying eyes on windy again when lo here he was with twenty two hundred letters in his sack the patrons of the gold nugget crowded round him like flies round a lump of sugar glad to pay a dollar apiece on each letter he handed out \"and you take all that s addressed to yer at that price or you get none \" every letter there had come over the terrible pass every one had travelled twelve hundred miles by dog team and some had been on the trail seven months here maudie me dear the postman handed her two letters \"see how he dotes on yer \" got anything fur what s yer names says the mackinaw man who seemed to have adopted the colonel and the boy he presented them without embarrassment to \"windy jim wilson of hog em junction the best trail mail carrier in the nited states \" those who had already got letters were gathered in groups under the bracket lights reading eagerly in the midst of the lull of satisfaction or expectancy someone cried out in disgust and another threw down a letter with a shower of objurgation guess you got the mate to mine bonsor said a bystander with a laugh slowly tearing up the communication he had opened with fingers so eager that they shook you pay a dollar apiece for letters from folks you never heard of asking you what you think of the country and whether you d advise em to come out huh don t i wish they would it s all right they will and then trust bonsor to git even salaman \"the luckiest man in camp who had come in from his valuable little min ok property for the night only had to pay fifteen dollars for his mail when he opened it he found he had one home letter written seven months before eight notes of inquiry and six advertisements maudie had put her letters unopened in her pocket and told the man at the scales to weigh out two dollars to windy and charge to her then she began to talk to the colonel the boy observed with scant patience that his pardner treated maudie with a consideration he could hardly have bettered had she been the first lady in the land must be because she s little and cute lookin the colonel s a sentimental ol goslin \" what makes you so polite to that dance hall girl muttered the boy aside \"she s no good \" reckon it won t make her any better for me to be impolite to her returned the colonel calmly but finding she could not detach the kentuckian from his pardner maudie bestowed her attention elsewhere french charlie was leaning back against the wall his hands jammed in his pockets and his big slouch hat pulled over his brows under the shadow of the wide brim furtively he watched the girl another woman came up and asked him to dance he shook his head reckon we d better go and knock up blandford keith and get a bed suggested the boy regretfully looking round for the man who had a cinch up on glory hallelujah and wouldn t tell you how to get there reckon we d better agreed the colonel but they halted near windy jim who was refreshing himself and at the same time telling dawson news or dawson lies as the company evidently thought and still the men crowded round listening greedily just as everybody devours certain public prints without ceasing to impeach their veracity lacking newspapers at which to pish and pshaw they listened to windy jim disbelieving the only unvarnished tale that gentleman had ever told for windy with the story teller s instinct knew marvellous enough would sound the bare recital of those awful dawson days when the unprecedented early winter stopped the provision boats at circle and starvation stared the over populated klondyke in the face having disposed of their letters the miners crowded round the courier to hear how the black business ended matter of special interest to min ok for the population here was composed chiefly of men who by the canadian route had managed to get to dawson in the autumn in the early days of the famine scare and who after someone s panic proposal to raid the great stores were given free passage down the river on the last two steamers to run when the ice stopped them one party at circle the other at fort yukon they had held up the supply boats and helped themselves under the noses of captain ray and lieutenant richardson u s a yes sir mcginty had explained \"we min ok boys was all in that picnic but we give our bond to pay up at mid summer and after the fun was over we dropped down here \" he pushed nearer to windy to hear how it had fared with the men who had stayed behind in the klondyke how the excitement flamed and menaced how agent hansen of the alaska commercial company greatest of the importers of provisions and arctic equipment rushed about half crazy making speeches all along the dawson river front urging the men to fly for their lives back to the states or up to circle before the ice stopped moving but too many of these men had put everything they had on earth into getting here too many had abandoned costly outfits on the awful pass or in the boiling eddies of the white horse rapids paying any price in money or in pain to get to the goldfields before navigation closed and now here was hansen with all the authority of the a c shouting wildly \"quick quick go up or down it s a race for life \" windy went on to tell how the horror of the thing dulled the men how they stood about the dawson streets helpless as cattle paralysed by the misery that had overtaken them all very well for hansen to try to relieve the congestion at the klondyke the poor devils knew that to go either way up or down as late as this meant death then it was whispered how captain constantine of the mounted police was getting ready to drive every man out of the klondyke at the point of the bayonet who couldn t show a thousand pounds of provisions yet most of the klondykers still stood about dazed silent waiting for the final stroke a few went up over the way they had come to die after all on the pass and some went down their white despairing faces disappearing round the klondyke bend as they drifted with the grinding ice towards the arctic circle where the food was caught in the floes and how one came back going by without ever turning his head caring not a jot for golden dawson serene as a king in his capital solitary stark on a little island of ice lord it was better after all at the big chimney oh it wasn t so bad said windy cheerfully \"about the time one o the big companies announced they was sold out o everything but sugar and axe handles a couple o steamers pushed their way in through the ice after all just as old j j healy said it was only a question of rations and proper distribution why flour s fell from one hundred and twenty dollars a sack to fifty and there s a big new strike on the island opposite ensley creek they call it monte cristo pay runs eight dollars to the pan lord dawson s the greatest gold camp on the globe \" but no matter what befell at dawson business must be kept brisk at min ok the pianola started up and buckin billy who called the dances began to bawl invitations to the company to come and waltz windy interrupted his own music for further refreshment pausing an instant with his mouth full of dried apple pie to say congress has sent out a relief expedition to dawson no fact reindeer ye mean peacocks mean reindeer it s all in the last paper come over the pass a reindeer relief expedition to save them poor starvin klondykers haw haw good old congress well did you find any o them reindeer doin any relievin round dawson naw what do you think takes more n congress to git over the dalton trail and windy returned to his pie talking earnestly with mr butts french charlie pushed heavily past the boy on his way to the bar from his gait it was clear that he had made many similar visits that evening in his thick canadian accent charlie was saying i blowed out a lot o dust for dat girl she s wearin my di mon now and won t look at me say butts i ll give you twenty dollars if you sneak dat ring done with you says butts as calm as a summer s day in two minutes maudie was twirling about with the handy gentleman who seemed as accomplished with his toes as he was reputed to be with his fingers he came up with her presently and ordered some wine wine b gosh muttered charlie in drunken appreciation propping himself against the wall again and always slipping sideways \"y tink he s d fines sor fella don t you hein wai n see \" the wine disappears and the two go off for another dance inside of ten minutes up comes butts and passes something to french charlie that gentleman laughs tipsily and leaning on butts s arm makes his way to the scales weigh out twen dollars dis gen man he ordered butts pulled up the string of his poke and slipped to one side as noise reached the group at the bar of a commotion at the other end of the saloon my ring it s gone my diamond ring now you ve got it and maudie came running out from the dancers after one of the woodworth gentlemen charlie straightened up and grinned almost sobered in excess of joy and satisfied revenge the woodworth gentleman is searched and presently exonerated everybody is told of the loss every nook and corner investigated maudie goes down on hands and knees even creeping behind the bar i know d she go on somethin awful said charlie so gleefully that bonsor the proprietor of the gold nugget began to look upon him with suspicion when maudie reappeared flushed and with disordered hair after her excursion under the counter french charlie confronted her looky here you treated me blame mean maudie but wha d you say if i s to off a rewar for dat ring reward a healthy lot o good that would do oh very well f you don wan de ring back i do charlie he hammered on the bar ev body gottah look fur ring i give a hunner n fifty dollah rewar maudie stared at the princely offer but instantly the commotion was greater than ever \"ev body\" did what was expected of them especially mr butts they flew about looking in possible and impossible places laughing screaming tumbling over one another in the midst of the uproar french charlie lurches up to maudie dat look anyt in like it oh charlie she looked the gratitude she could not on the instant speak in the midst of the noise and movement the mackinaw man said to the boy don t know as you d care to see my new prospect hole course i d like to see it well come along tomorrow afternoon meet me here bout two don t say nothin to nobody he added still lower \"we don t want to get overrun before we ve recorded \" the boy could have hugged that mackinaw man outside it was broad day but still the gold nugget lights were flaring and the pianola played they had learned from the bartender where to find blandford keith \"in the worst looking shack in the camp \" but \"it looks good to me said the boy as they went in and startled keith out of his first sleep the man that brings you letters before the ice goes out is your friend keith helped them to bring in their stuff and was distinctly troubled because the travellers wouldn t take his bunk they borrowed some dry blankets and went to sleep on the floor it was after two when they woke in a panic lest the mackinaw man should have gone without them while the colonel got breakfast the boy dashed round to the gold nugget found si mcginty playing craps and would have brought him back in triumph to breakfast but no he would wait down yonder below the gold nugget and don t you say nothin yit about where we re goin or we ll have the hull town at our heels \" about twelve miles \"back in the mountains\" is a little gulch that makes into a big one at right angles that s the pup where my claim is the what little creek call em pups here down in the desolate hollow a ragged a tent sagged away from the prevailing wind inside they found that the canvas was a mere shelter over a prospect hole a rusty stove was almost buried by the heap of earth and gravel thrown up from a pit several feet deep this is a winter diggins y see observed the mackinaw man with pride \"it s only while the ground is froze solid you can do this kind o minin i ve had to burn the ground clean down to bed rock yes sir thawed my way inch by inch to the old channel \" well and what have you found s pose we pan some o this dirt and see his slow caution impressed his hearers they made up a fire melted snow and half filled a rusty pan with gravel and soil from the bottom of the pit know how to pan the colonel and the boy took turns they were much longer at it than they ever were again but the mackinaw man seemed not in the least hurry the impatience was all theirs when they had got down to fine sand \"look \" screamed the boy by the lord said the colonel softly is that looks like you got some colours there gosh then i ain t been dreamin after all hey dreamin what look look that s why i brought you gen l men out says the mackinaw man \"i was afraid to trust my senses thought i was gettin wheels in my head \" lord look at the gold they took about a dollar and twenty cents out of that pan now see here you gen l men jest lay low about this strike his anxiety seemed intense they reassured him \"i don t suppose you mind our taking up a claim apiece next you pleaded the boy since the law don t allow you to stake more n one \" oh that s all right said the mackinaw man with an air of princely generosity \"and i don t mind if you like to let in a few of your particular pals if you ll agree to help me organise a district an i ll do the recordin fur ye \" really this mackinaw man was a trump the colonel took twenty five dollars out of a roll of bills and handed it to him what s this fur for bringing us out for giving us the tip i d make it more but till i get to dawson oh laughed the mackinaw man \" that s all right and indifferently he tucked the bills into his baggy trousers the colonel felt keenly the inadequacy of giving a man twenty five dollars who had just introduced him to hundreds of thousands and who sat on the edge of his own gold mine but it was only on account \" the colonel staked no above the discovery and the boy was in the act of staking no below when no no says that kind mackinaw man \"the heavier gold will be found further up the gulch stake no above\" and he told them natural facts about placer mining that no after expert knowledge could ever better but he was not as happy as a man should be who has just struck pay fact is it s kind of upsettin to find it so rich here give you leave to upset me that way all day y see i bought another claim over yonder where i done a lot o work last summer and fall built a cabin and put up a sluice i got to be up there soon as the ice goes out don t see how i got time to do my assessment here too wish i was twins why don t you sell this guess i ll have to part with a share in it he sighed and looked lovingly into the hole \"minin s an awful gamble he said as though admonishing si mcginty but we know there s gold just there \" the colonel and the boy looked at their claims and felt the pinch of uncertainty \"what do you want for a share in your claim mr mcginty \" oh well as i say i ll let it go reasonable to a feller who d do the assessment on account o my having that other property say three thousand dollars the colonel shook his head \"why it s dirt cheap two men can take a hundred and fifty dollars a day out of that claim without outside help and properly worked the summer ought to show forty thousand dollars \" on the way home mcginty found he could let the thing go for \"two thousand spot cash \" make it quarter shares suggested the boy thrilled at such a chance and the colonel and i together ll raise five hundred and do the rest of the assessment work for you but they were nearly back at min ok before mcginty said \"well i ain t twins and i can t personally work two gold mines so we ll call it a deal \" and the money passed that night and the word passed too to an ex governor of a western state and his satellites newly arrived from woodworth and to a party of men just down from circle city mcginty seemed more inclined to share his luck with strangers than with the men he had wintered amongst \"mean lot these min ok fellers \" but the return of the ex governor and so large a party from quietly staking their claims roused min ok to a sense that somethin was goin on by mcginty s advice the strangers called a secret meeting and elected mcginty recorder all the claim holders registered their properties and the dates of location the recorder gave everybody his receipt and everybody felt it was cheap at five dollars then the meeting proceeded to frame a code of laws for the new district stipulating the number of feet permitted each claim being rigidly kept by mcginty within the limits provided by the united states laws on the subject and decreeing the amount of work necessary to hold a claim a year settling questions of water rights etc etc not until glory hallelujah gulch was a full fledged mining district did min ok in general know what was in the wind the next day the news was all over camp if mcginty s name inspired suspicion the colonel s and the ex governor s reassured the colonel in particular he had already established that credit that came so easy to him being triumphantly quoted as saying \"glory hallelujah gulch was the richest placer he d ever struck \" nobody added that it was also the only one but this matter of a stampede is not controlled by reason it is a thing of the nerves while you are ridiculing someone else your legs are carrying you off on the same errand in a mining camp the saloon is the community s heart however little a man cares to drink or to dance or to play cards he goes to the saloon as to the one place where he may meet his fellows do business and hear the news the saloon is the market place it is also the caf the theatre the club the stock exchange the barber s shop the bank in short you might as well be dead as not be a patron of the gold nugget yet neither the colonel nor the boy had been there since the night of their arrival on returning from that first triumphant inspection of mcginty s diggings the colonel had been handed a sealed envelope without address how do you know it s for me she said it was for the big chap answered blandford keith the colonel read come to the gold nugget as soon as you get this and hear something to your advantage maudie so he had stayed away having plenty to occupy him in helping to organise the new district he was strolling past the saloon the morning after the secret meeting when down into the street like a kingfisher into a stream maudie darted and held up the colonel ain t you had my letter oh a yes but i ve been busy guess so she said with undisguised scorn \"where s si mcginty \" reckon he s out at the gulch i ve got to go down to the a c now and buy some grub to take out he was moving on take where she followed him up to mcginty s gulch what for why to live on while my pardner and i do the assessment work then it s true mcginty s been fillin you full o guff the colonel looked at her a little haughtily see here i ain t busy as a rule about other folks funerals but she looked at him curiously \"it s cold here come in a minute \" there was no hint of vulgar nonsense but something very earnest in the pert little face that had been so pretty they went in \"order drinks she said aside and don t talk before jimmie \" she chaffed the bartender and leaned idly against the counter when a group of returned stampeders came in she sat down at a rough little faro table leaned her elbows on it sipped the rest of the stuff in her tumbler through a straw and in the shelter of her arms set the straw in a knot hole near the table leg and spirited the bad liquor down under the board \"don t give me away she said the colonel knew she got a commission on the drinks and was there to bring custom he nodded i hoped i d see you in time she went on hurriedly in time to warn you that mcginty was givin you a song and dance \" hey tellin you a ghost story \" you mean can t you understand plain english she said irritated at such obtuseness \"i got worried thinkin it over for it was me told that pardner o yours \" she smiled wickedly \"i expected mcginty d have some fun with the young feller but i didn t expect you d be such a hatter \" she wound up with the popular reference to lunacy the colonel pulled up his great figure with some pomposity \"i don t understand \" any feller can see that you re just the kind the mcgintys are layin for she looked round to see that nobody was within earshot \"si s been layin round all winter waitin for the spring crop o suckers \" if you mean there isn t gold out at mcginty s gulch you re wrong i ve seen it course you have he paused she sweeping the gold nugget with vigilant eye went on in a voice of indulgent contempt some of em load up an old shot gun with a little charge o powder and a quarter of an ounce of gold dust on top fire that into the prospect hole a dozen times or so and then take a sucker out to pan the stuff but i bet si didn t take any more trouble with you than to have some colours in his mouth to spit in the shovel or the pan when you wasn t lookin just enough to drive you crazy and get you to boost him into a recordership why he s cleaned up a tub o money in fees since you struck the town the colonel moved uneasily but faith with him died hard mcginty strikes me as a very decent sort of man with a knowledge of practical mining and of mining law maudie made a low sound of impatience and pushed her empty glass aside oh very well go your own way waste the whole spring doin si s assessment for him and when the bottom drops out o recordin you ll see si gettin some cheechalko to buy an interest in that rottin hole o his her jaw fell as she saw the colonel s expression he s got you too she exclaimed well didn t you say yourself that night you d be glad if mcginty d let you a lay pshaw i was only givin you a song and dance not you neither but that pardner o yours i thought i d learn that young man a lesson but i didn t know you d get flim flammed out o your boots thought you looked like you got some sense unmoved by the colonel s aspect of offended dignity faintly dashed with doubt she hurried on before you go shellin out any more cash or haulin stuff to glory hallelujah just you go down that prospect hole o mcginty s when mcginty ain t there and see how many colours you can ketch the colonel looked at her well i ll do it he said slowly \"and if you re right \" oh i m all right she laughed \"an i know my mcginty backwards but\" she frowned with sudden anger \"it ain t maudie s pretty way to interfere with cheechalkos gettin fooled i ain t proud o the trouble i ve taken and i ll thank you not to mention it not to that pardner o yours not to nobody \" she stuck her nose in the air and waved her hand to french charlie who had just then opened the door and put his head in he came straight over to her and she made room for him on the bench the colonel went out full of thought he listened attentively when the ex governor that evening at keith s said something about the woman up at the gold nugget \"maudie what s the rest of her name \" don t believe anybody knows oh yes they must too it ll be on her deeds she s got the best hundred by fifty foot lot in the place held it down last fall herself with a six shooter and she owns that cabin on the corner isn t a better business head in min ok than maudie s she got a lay on a good property o salaman s last fall and i guess she s got more ready dust even now before the washin begins than anybody here except salaman and the a c there ain t a man in min ok who wouldn t listen respectfully to maudie s views on any business proposition once he was sure she wasn t fooling and keith told a string of stories to show how the min ok miners admired her astuteness and helped her unblushingly to get the better of one another the colonel stayed in min ok till the recording was all done and mcginty got tired of living on flap jacks at the gulch the night mcginty arrived in town the colonel not even taking the boy into his confidence hitched up and departed for the new district he came back the next day a sadder and a wiser man they had been sold mcginty was quick to gather that someone must have given him away it had only been a question of time after all he had lined his pockets and could take the new turn in his affairs with equanimity wait till the steamers begin to run maudie said \"mcginty ll play that game with every new boat load oh mcginty ll make another fortune then he ll go to dawson and blow it in well colonel sorry you ain t cultivatin rheumatism in a damp hole up at glory hallelujah \" i i am very much obliged to you for saving me from she cut him short \"you see you ve got time now to look about you for something really good if there is anything outside of little min ok \" it was very kind of you to no it wasn t she said shortly the colonel took out a roll of bank bills and selected one folded it small and passed it towards her under the ledge of the table she glanced down oh i don t want that yes please tell you i don t you ve done me a very good turn saved me a lot of time and expense slowly she took the money as one thinking out something where do you come from he asked suddenly frisco i was in the chorus at the alcazar what made you go into the chorus got tired o life on a sheep ranch all work and no play never saw a soul seen plenty since got any people belonging to you got a kind of a husband a kind of a husband yes the kind you d give away with a pound o tea the little face full of humourous contempt and shrewd scorn sobered she flung a black look round the saloon and her eyes came back to the colonel s face i ve got a girl she said and a sudden light flashed across her frowning as swiftly as a meteor cuts down along a darkened sky \"four years old in june she ain t goin into no chorus bet your life she s going to have money and scads o things i ain t never had \" that night the colonel and the boy agreed that although they had wasted some valuable time and five hundred and twenty five dollars on mcginty they still had a chance of making their fortunes before the spring rush the next day they went eight miles out in slush and in alternate rain and sunshine to little min ok creek where the biggest paying claims were universally agreed to be they found a place even more ragged and desolate than mcginty s where smoke was rising sullenly from underground fires and the smell of burning wood filled the air the ground turned up and dotted at intervals with piles of frozen gravel that had been hoisted from the shafts by windlass forlorn little cabins and tents scattered indiscriminately a vast number of empty bottles and cans sown broadcast and early as it was a line of sluices upon salaman s claim they had heard a great deal about the dark keen looking young oregon lawyer for salaman was the most envied man in min ok \"come over to my dump and get some nuggets says mr salaman as in other parts of the world a man will say come into the smoking room and have a cigar \" the snow was melted from the top of salaman s dump and his guests had no difficulty in picking several rough little bits of gold out of the thawing gravel it was an exhilarating occupation come down my shaft and see my cross cuts and they followed him he pointed out how the frozen gravel made solid wall or pillar and no curbing was necessary with the aid of a candle and their host s urging they picked out several dollars worth of coarse gold from the gravel \"in place\" at the edge of the bed rock when he had got his guests thoroughly warmed up yes i took out several thousand last fall and i ll have twenty thousand more out of my first summer clean up and after that after that i m going home i wouldn t stay here and work this way and live this way another winter not for twenty millions i m surprised to hear you talking like that sah well you won t be once you have tried it yourself mining up here s an awful gamble colours pretty well everywhere and a few flakes of flour gold just enough to send the average cheechalko crazy but no real pay outside of this little gulch and even here every inch has been scrambled for and staked too and lots of it fought over men died here in the fall defending their ground from the jumpers ground that hadn t a dollar in it well your ground was worth looking after and john dillon s which is his claim salaman led the way over the heaps of gravel and round a windlass to no admitting oh yes dillon and i and a few others have come out of it all right but lord it s a gamble dillon s pardner kennedy did the honours showing the big chimney men the very shaft out of which their christmas heap of gold had been hoisted it was true after all for the favoured there was \"plenty o gold plenty o gold \" but said salaman \"there are few things more mysterious than its whereabouts or why it should be where it is don t talk to me about mining experts we ve had em here but who can explain the mystery of min ok there are six claims in all this country that pay to work the pay begins in no before that nothing just up yonder above no the pay streak pinches out no mortal knows why a whole winter s toiling and moiling and thousands of dollars put into the ground haven t produced an ounce of gold above that claim or below no i tell you it s an awful gamble hunter creek hoosier bear big min ok i you quail alder mike hess little nell the whole blessed country rivers creeks pups and all staked for a radius of forty miles just because there s gold here where we re standing \" you don t mean there s nothing left nothing within forty miles that somebody hasn t either staked or made money by abandoning made money salaman laughed it s money in your pocket pretty nearly every time you don t take up a claim why on hunter alone they ve spent twenty thousand dollars this winter and how much have they taken out with index finger and thumb salaman made an \"o and looked shrewdly through it it s an awful gamble he repeated solemnly it doesn t seem possible there s nothing left reiterated the boy incredulous of such evil luck oh i m not saying you may not make something by getting on some other fellow s property if you ve a mind to pay for it but you d better not take anything on trust i wouldn t trust my own mother in alaska something in the air here that breeds lies you can t believe anybody yourself included \" he laughed stooped and picked a little nugget out of the dump \"you ll have the same man tell you an entirely different story about the same matter within an hour exaggeration is in the air the best man becomes infected you lie he lies they all lie lots of people go crazy in alaska every year various causes but it s chiefly from believing their own lies \" they returned to rampart it was decidedly inconvenient considering the state of their finances to have thrown away that five hundred dollars on mcginty they messed with keith and paid their two thirds of the household expenses but dawson prices reigned and it was plain there were no dawson prizes well said the colonel in the morning \"we ve got to live somehow till the ice goes out \" the boy sat thinking the colonel went on \"and we can t go to dawson cleaned out no tellin whether there are any proper banks there or whether my louisville instructions got through of course we ve got the dogs yet \" don t care how soon we sell red and spot after breakfast the boy tied nig up securely behind keith s shack and followed the colonel about with a harassed and watchful air no market for dogs now seemed to be the general opinion and one person bore up well under the news but the next day a man very splashed and muddy and obviously just in from the gulches stopped in going by keith s and looked at nig dog market s down quoted the boy internally to hearten himself that mahlemeut s for sale observed the colonel to the stranger these are the boy hastily dragged red and spot upon the scene how much seventy five dollars apiece the man laughed \"ain t you heard the dog season s over \" well don t you count on livin to the next the man pushed his slouch over his eyes and scratched the back of his head unless i can git em reasonable dogs ain t worth feedin till next winter i suppose not said the boy sympathetically \"and you can t get fish here \" right feedin yourn on bacon i s pose at forty cents a pound bacon and meal \" guess you ll get tired o that well we d sell you the red dog for sixty dollars admitted the boy the man stared \"give you thirty for that black brute over there \" thirty dollars for nig and not a cent more dogs is down he could get a dozen as good for twenty five dollars just you try but the colonel grumbling said thirty dollars was thirty dollars and he reckoned he d call it a deal the boy stared opened his mouth to protest and shut it without a sound the colonel had untied nig and the leader unmindful of the impending change in his fortunes dashed past the muddy man from the gulch with such impetuosity that he knocked that gentleman off his legs he picked himself up scowling and was feeling for his gold sack got scales here no need of scales the boy whipped out a little roll of money counted out thirty dollars and held it towards the colonel \"i can afford to keep nig awhile if that s his figure \" the stranger was very angry at this new turn in the dog deal he had seen that siwash out at the gulch heard he was for sale and came in a purpose to git him the dog season s over said the boy pulling nig s ears and smiling oh is it well the season for eatin meals ain t over how m i to git grub out to my claim without a dog we are offerin you a couple o capital draught dogs i bought that there siwash and i d a paid fur him if he hadn t a knocked me down he advanced threateningly \"an if you ain t huntin trouble \" the big colonel stepped in and tried to soothe the stranger as well as to convince him that this was not the party to try bullying on i ll give you forty dollars for the dog said the muddy man sulkily to the boy no give you fifty and that s my last word i ain t sellin dogs he cursed and offered five dollars more can t you see i mean it i m goin to keep that dog awhile s pose you think you ll make a good thing o hirin him out he hadn t thought of it but he said \"why not best dog in the yukon \" well how much how much ll you give dollar a day done so nig was hired out spot was sold for twenty dollars and red later for fifteen well said the colonel when they went in \"i didn t know you were so smart but you can t live here on nig s seven dollars a week \" the boy shook his head their miserable canned and salted fare cost about four dollars a day per man i m goin to take nig s tip he said \"goin to work \" easier said than done in their high rubber boots they splashed about rampart in the mild thawing weather \"tryin to scare up a job as one of them stopped to explain to every likely person yes sah lookin for any sort of honourable employment till the ice goes out \" nothin doin everything s at a standstill just keepin body and soul together myself till the boats come in they splashed out to the gulch on the same errand yes wages were fifteen dollars a day when they were busy just now they were waiting for the thorough thaw should think it was pretty thorough without any waitin salaman shook his head \"only in the town and tundra the frost holds on to the deep gulch gravel like grim death and the diggin s were already full of men ready to work for their keep at least they say so salaman added not only in the great cities is human flesh and blood held cheaper than that of the brutes even in the off season when dogs was down nig could get his dollar a day but his masters couldn t get fifty cents chapter xvii the great stampede die menchen suchen und suchen wollen immer was besseres finden gott geb ihnen nur geduld \" men in the gold nugget were talking about some claims staked and recorded in due form but on which the statutory work had not been done what about em they re jumpable at midnight french charlie invited the boy to go along but neither he nor the colonel felt enthusiastic they re no good those claims except to sell to some sucker and we re not in that business yet sah they had just done twenty miles in slush and mire and their hearts were heavier than their heels no they would go to bed while the others did the jumpin and next day they would fill keith s wood bin so if work does turn up we won t have to worry about usin up his firin in the chill of the next evening they were cording the results of the day s chopping when maudie in fur coat skirts to the knee and high rubber boots appeared behind keith s shack without deigning to notice the boy \"ain t seen you all day says she to the colonel busy he replied scarcely looking up did you do any jumpin last night \" no that s all right she seated herself with satisfaction on a log she looked at the boy impudently as much as to say \"when that blot on the landscape is removed i ll tell you something \" the boy had not the smallest intention of removing the blot grudgingly he admitted to himself that away from the unsavory atmosphere of the gold nugget there was nothing in maudie positively offensive at this moment with her shrewd little face peering pertly out from her parki hood she looked more than ever like an audacious child or like some strange new little arctic animal with a whimsical human air look here colonel she said presently either despairing of getting rid of the boy or ceasing to care about it \"you got to get a wiggle on to morrow \" what for she looked round first over one shoulder then over the other \"well it s on the quiet \" the kentuckian nodded but she winked her blue eyes suspiciously at the boy oh he s all right well you been down to little min ok ain t you yes and you seen how the pay pinches out above no yes well now if it ain t above no where is it no answer \"where does it go \" she repeated severely like a schoolmarm to a class of backward boys that s what everybody d like to know then let em ask pitcairn what s pitcairn say she got up briskly moved to another log almost at the colonel s feet and sat looking at him a moment as if making up her mind about something serious the colonel stood fists at his sides arrested by that name pitcairn you know pitcairn s the best all round man we got here she asserted rather than asked the colonel nodded he s an idaho miner pitcairn is i know well he s been out lookin at the place where the gold gives out on little min ok there s a pup just there above no remember perfectly and above the pup on the right there s a bed of gravel couldn t see much of that for the snow well sir that bed o gravel s an old channel no she nodded \"pitcairn s sunk a prospect and found colours in his first pan \" oh colours but the deeper he went the better prospects he got she stood up now close to the colonel the boy stopped work and leaned on the wood pile listening \"pitcairn told charlie and me on the strict q t that the gold channel crossed the divide at no and the only gold on little min okust what spilt down on those six claims as the gold went crossin the gulch the real placer is that old channel above the pup and boys\" in her enthusiasm she even included the colonel s objectionable pardner \"boys it s rich as blazes \" i wonder drawled the colonel recovering a little from his first thrill i wouldn t advise you to waste much time wonderin she said with fire \"what i m tellin you is scientific pitcairn is straight as a string you won t get any hymns out o pitcairn but you ll get fair and square his news is worth a lot if you got any natchral gumption anywhere about you you can have a claim worth anything from ten to fifty thousand dollars this time to morrow \" well well good lord hey boy what we goin to do well you don t want to get excited admonished the queer little arctic animal jumping up suddenly \"but you can bunk early and get a four a m wiggle on charlie and me ll meet you on the min okl ta ta \" tad she whisked away as suddenly as a chipmunk they couldn t sleep some minutes before the time named they were quietly leaving keith s shack out on the trail there were two or three men already disappearing towards little min ok here was maudie all by herself sprinting along like a good fellow on the thin surface of the last night s frost she walked in native water boots but her snow shoes stuck out above the small pack neatly lashed on her straight little shoulders they waited for her she came up very brisk and businesslike to their good mornings she only nodded in a funny preoccupied way never opening her lips charlie gone on inquired the colonel presently she shook her head \"knocked out \" been fightin no ran a race to hunter to jump that claim she nodded did he beat she laughed \"butts had the start they got there together at nine o clock \" three hours before jumpin time again she nodded \"and found four more waitin on the same fool errand \" what did they do called a meetin couldn t agree it looked like there d be a fight and a fast race to the recorder among the survivors but before the meetin was adjourned those four that had got there first they were pretty gay a ready they opened some hootch so butts and charlie knew they d nothing to fear except from one another on the top of the divide that gave them their last glimpse of rampart she stopped an instant and looked back the quick flash of anxiety deepening to defiance made the others turn the bit they could see of the water front thoroughfare was alive the inhabitants were rushing about like a swarm of agitated ants what s happening it s got out she exploded indignantly \"they re comin too \" she turned flew down the steep incline and then settled into a steady determined gait that made her gain on the men who had got so long a start her late companions stood looking back in sheer amazement for the town end of the trail was black with figures the boy began to laugh look if there isn t old jansen and his squaw wife the rheumatic cripple huddled on a sled was drawn by a native man and pushed by a native woman they could hear him swearing at both impartially in broken english and chinook the colonel and the boy hurried after maudie it was some minutes before they caught up the boy feeling that he couldn t be stand offish in the very act of profiting by her acquaintance began to tell her about the crippled but undaunted swede she made no answer just trotted steadily on the boy hazarded another remark an opinion that she was making uncommon good time for a woman you ll want all the wind you got before you get back she said shortly and silence fell on the stampeders some of the young men behind were catching up maudie set her mouth very firm and quickened her pace this spectacle touched up those that followed they broke into a canter floundered in a drift recovered and passed on maudie pulled up that s all right let em get good and tired half way we got to save all the run we got in us for the last lap the sun was hotter the surface less good she loosened her shoulder straps released her snow shoes and put them on as she tightened her little pack the ex governor came puffing up with apoplectic face why she can throw the diamond hitch he gasped with admiration s pose you thought the squaw hitch would be good enough for me well it is for me he laughed breathlessly that s cause you re an ex governor and steadily she tramped along in twenty minutes maudie s party came upon those same young men who had passed running they sat in a row on a fallen spruce one had no rubber boots the other had come off in such a hurry he had forgotten his snow shoes already they were wet to the waist step out maudie said one with short breathed hilarity \"we ll be treadin on your heels in a minute \" but they were badly blown maudie wasted not a syllable her mouth began to look drawn there were violet shadows under the straight looking eyes the colonel glanced at her now and then is she thinking about that four year old is maudie stampedin through the snow so that other little woman need never dance at the alcazar no the colonel knew well enough that maudie rather liked this stampedin business she had passed one of those men who had got the long start of her he carried a pack once in a while she would turn her strained looking face over her shoulder glancing back with the frank eyes of an enemy at her fellow citizens labouring along the trail come on colonel she commanded with a new sharpness \"keep up your lick \" but the colonel had had about enough of this gait from now on he fell more and more behind but the boy was with her neck and neck guess you re goin to get there guess i am some men behind them began to run they passed they had pulled off their parkis and left them where they fell they threw off their caps now and the sweat rolled down their faces not a countenance but wore that immobile look the fixed unseeing eye of the spent runner who is overtaxing heart and lungs not only maudie now but everyone was silent occasionally a man would rouse himself out of a walk as if out of sleep and run a few yards going the more weakly after several of the men who had been behind caught up where was kentucky if maudie wondered she wasted no time over the speculation for his own good she had admonished him to keep up his lick but of course the main thing was that maudie should keep up hers what if this is the great day of my life thought the boy \"shall i always look back to this why it s sunday wonder if kentucky remembers \" never pausing the boy glanced back vaguely amused and saw the colonel plunging heavily along in front of half a dozen who were obviously out of condition for such an expedition eyes bloodshot lumbering on with nervous \"whisky gait now whipped into a breathless gallop now half falling by the way another of the gold nugget women with two groggy looking men and somewhere down the trail the crippled swede swearing at his squaw a dreamy feeling came over the boy where in the gold basins of the north was this kind of thing not happening finished yesterday or planned for to morrow yes it was typical between patches of ragged black spruce wide stretches of snow covered moss under a lowering sky and a mob of men floundering through the drifts to find a fortune see how they run \" mad mice they d been going on stampedes all winter and would go year in year out until they died the prizes were not for such as they as for himself ah it was a great day for him he was going at last to claim that gold mine he had come so far to find this was the decisive moment of his life at the thought he straightened up and passed maudie she gave him a single sidelong look unfriendly even fierce that was because he could run like sixty and keep it up \"when i m a millionaire i shall always remember that i m rich because i won the race \" a dizzy feeling came over him he seemed to be running through some softly resisting medium like water no like wine jelly his heart was pounding up in his throat \"what if something s wrong and i drop dead on the way to my mine well kentucky ll look after things \" maudie had caught up again and here was little min ok at last a couple of men who from the beginning had been well in advance of everyone else and often out of sight had seemed for the last five minutes to be losing ground but now they put on steam maudie too she stepped out of her snowshoes and flung them up on the low roof of the first cabin then she ducked her head crooked her arms at the elbow and with fists uplifted she broke into a run jumping from pile to pile of frozen pay gliding under sluice boxes scrambling up the bank slipping on the rotting ice recovering dashing on over fallen timber and through waist deep drifts on beyond no up to the bench above when the boy got to pitcairn s prospect hole there were already six claims gone he proceeded to stake the seventh next to maudie s that person with flaming cheeks was driving her last location post into a snow drift with a piece of water worn obsidian the colonel came along in time to stake no below under maudie s personal supervision not much use in her opinion \"except that with gold it s where you find it and that s all any man can tell you \" as she was returning alone to her own claim behold two brawny circle city miners pulling out her stakes and putting in their own she flew at them with remarks unprintable you keep your head shut advised one of the men a big evil looking fellow \"this was our claim first we was here with pitcairn yesterday somebody s took away our location posts \" you take me for a cheechalko she screamed and her blue eyes flashed like smitten steel she pulled up her sweater and felt in her belt you take your stakes out put mine back unless you want a murderous looking revolver gleamed in her hand hold on said the spokesman hurriedly \"can t you take a joke \" no this ain t my day for jokin you want to put them stakes o mine back she stood on guard till it was done \"and now i d advise you like a mother to back track home you ll find this climate very tryin to your health \" they went farther up the slope and marked out a claim on the incline above the bench in a few hours the mountain side was staked to the very top and still the stream of people struggled out from rampart to the scene of the new strike all day long and all the night the trail was alive with the coming or the going of the five hundred and odd souls that made up the population in the town itself the excitement grew rather than waned men talked themselves into a fever others took fire and the epidemic spread like some obscure nervous disease nobody slept everybody drank and hurrahed and said it was the greatest night in the history of min ok in the gold nugget saloon crowded to suffocation pitcairn organized the new mining district and named it the idaho bar french charlie and keith had gone out late in the day on their return keith sold his stake to a woman for twenty five dollars and charlie advertised a half interest in his for five thousand between these two extremes you could hear idaho bar quoted at any figure you liked maudie was in towering spirits she drank several cocktails and in her knee length \"stampedin skirt\" and her scarlet sweater she danced the most audacious jig even maudie had ever presented to the gold nugget patrons the miners yelled with delight one of them caught her up and put her on the counter of the bar where no whit at a loss she curveted and spun among the bottles and the glasses as lightly as a dragonfly dips and whirls along a summer brook the enthusiasm grew delirious the men began to throw nuggets at her and maudie never pausing in the dance caught them on the fly suddenly she saw the big chap turn away and with his back to her pretend to read the notice on the wall written in charcoal on a great sheet of brown wrapping paper min ok april to who it may concern know all men by these presents that i james mcginty now of min ok or rampart city alaska do hereby give notice of my intention to hold and claim a lien by virtue of the statue in such case he had read so far when maudie having jumped down off the bar with her fists full of nuggets and dodging her admirers wormed her way to the colonel she thrust her small person in between the notice and the reader and scrutinised the tanned face on which the rochester burners shed a flood of light \"you lookin mighty serious she said am i \" m hm thinkin bout home sweet home n no not just then say i told you bout a bout me you ain t never told me nothin he seemed not to know the answer to that and pulled at his ragged beard she leaned back against mcginty s notice and blurred still more the smudged intention \"by virtue of the statue \" married o course she said no widder no never hitched up yet he shook his head never goin to i s pose oh i don t know he laughed and turned his head over his shoulder to the curious scene between them and the bar it was suddenly as if he had never seen it before then while maudie waited a little scornful a little kind his eyes went through the window to the pink and orange sunrise as some change came over the colonel s face \"she died \" said maudie no no she didn t die then half to himself half to forestall maudie s crude probing \"but i lost her he finished oh you lost her \" he stood looking past the ugliness within to the morning majesty without but it was not either that he saw maudie studied him guess you ain t give up expectin to find her some day no no not quite humph did you guess you d find her here no and his absent smile seemed to remove him leagues away \"no not here \" i could a told you she began savagely \"i don t know for certain whether any what you call good women come up here but i m dead sure none stay \" when do you leave for home maudie he said gently but at the flattering implication the oddest thing happened as she stood there with her fists full of gold maudie s eyes filled she turned abruptly and went out the crowd began to melt away in half an hour only those remained who had more hootch than they could carry off the premises they made themselves comfortable on the floor near the stove and the greatest night min ok had known was ended chapter xviii a miners meeting leiden oder triumphiren hammer oder amboss sein goethe in a good sized cabin owned by bonsor down near the a c judge corey was administering miners law the chief magistrate was already a familiar figure standing on his dump at little min ok speculatively chewing and discussing \"glayshal action but most of the time at the gold nugget chewing still and discussing more guardedly the action some min ok man was threatening to bring against another you may treat a glacier cavalierly but miners law is a serious matter corey was sitting before a deal table littered with papers strewn round a central bottle of ink in which a steel pen stuck upright the judge wore his usual dilapidated business suit of brown cheviot that had once been snuff coloured and was now a streaky drab on his feet stretched out under the magisterial table till they joined the jury a pair of moccasins on his grizzled head a cowboy hat set well back he could spit farther than any man in min ok and by the same token was a better shot they had unanimously elected him judge the first comers had taken possession of the chairs and wooden stools round the stove all the later arrivals including keith and his friends sat on the floor there s a good many here \" they ll keep comin as long as a lean man can scrouge in yes said keith \"everybody s got to come even if it s only the usual row between pardners who want to part and can t agree about dividing the outfit \" got to come keith laughed \"that s the way everybody feels there ll be a debate and a chance to cast a vote isn t your true born american always itching to hold a meeting about something \" don t know about that said mcginty \"but i do know there s more things happens in a minute to make a man mad in alaska than happens in a year anywhere else \" and his sentiment was loudly applauded the plaintiff had scored a hit i don t know but two partnerships the ex governor was saying \"of all those on my ship and on the muckluck and the may west just two that have stood the alaska strain everyone that didn t break on the boats or in camp went to smash on the trail \" they all admitted that the trail was the final test while they smoked and spat into or at the stove and told trail yarns the chief magistrate arranged papers conferred with the clerk and another man wrinkled deeply his leathery forehead consulted his waterbury and shot tobacco juice under the table another reason everybody comes whispered keith \"is because the side that wins always takes the town up to the nugget and treats to hootch whenever you see eighty or ninety more drunks than usual you know there s either been a stampede or else justice has been administered \" ain t bonsor late asked someone no it s a quarter of why do they want bonsor his case on the docket mcginty v burt bonsor proprietor of the gold nugget if they got a row on if they got a row course they got a row weren t they pardners but mcginty spends all his time at the gold nugget well where would he spend it a miners meetin s a pretty poor machine mcginty was saying to the ex governor \"but it s the best we got \" in a country bigger than several of the nations of europe put together responded that gentleman with much public spirit a great country right you bet a country that s paid for its purchase over and over again even before we discovered gold here did she good old laska and the worst treated part o the union that s so after this when i read about russian corruption and chinese cruelty i ll remember the way uncle sam treats the natives up and us b gosh white men that are openin up this great rich country fur uncle sam with no proper courts no government protection no help no justice no nothin yer forgittin them reindeer and the court room rang with derisive laughter congress started that there relief expedition all right the josher went on \"only them blamed reindeer had got the feed habit and when they d et up everything in sight they set down on the dalton trail and there they re settin yit just like they was congress but i don t like to hear no feller talkin agin the gover ment \" yes it s all very funny said mcginty gloomily \"but think o the fix a feller s in wot s had a wrong done him in the fall and knows justice is thousands o miles away and he can t even go after her for eight months and in them eight months the feller wot robbed him has et up the money or worked out the claim and gone dead broke \" no sir we don t wait and we don t go trav lin we stay at home and call a meetin the door opened and bonsor and the bar tender with great difficulty forced their way in they stood flattened against the wall during the diversion mcginty was growling disdainfully \"rubbidge \" rubbidge reckon it s pretty serious rubbidge did you ever know a miners meetin to make a decision that didn t become law with the whole community ready to enforce it if necessary rubbidge oh we ll hang a man if we don t like his looks grumbled mcginty but he was overborne there were a dozen ready to uphold the majesty of the miners meetin no sir no funny business about our law this tribunal s final \" i ain t disputin that it s final i ain t talkin about law i was mentionin justice the feller that loses is always gassin bout justice when you win you don t think there s any flies on the justice ain t had much experience with winnin we all knows who wins in these yere meetin s who but they turned their eyes on mr bonsor over by the door who wins repeated a circle city man the feller that s got the most friends it s so whispered keith same at circle returned the up river man mcginty looked at him was this a possible adherent you got a push at circle he inquired but without genuine interest in the civil administration up the river \"why fore this yere town was organised when we hadn t got no court of arbitration to fix a boundary or even to hang a thief we had our main push just like we was frisco \" he lowered his voice and leaned towards his circle friend \"with bonsor s help they lected corey judge o the p lice court and bonsor ain t never let corey forgit it \" what about the other inquired a bonsorite \"the shifty push that got you in for city marshal \" what s the row on to night inquired the circle city man oh bonsor over there he lit out on a stampede bout christmas and while he was gone a feller by the name o lawrence quit the game fanned out one night at the gold nugget i seen for days he was wantin to be a angil and i kep a eye on im well when he went to the boneyard course it was my business bein city marshal to take possession of his property fur his heirs there was unseemly laughter behind the stove pipe among his deeds and traps mcginty went on unheeding \"there was fifteen hundred dollars in money well sir when bonsor gits back he decides he d like to be the custodian o that cash mentions his idee to me i jest natchrally tell him to go to hell no sir he goes to corey over there and gits an order o the court makin bonsor administrator o the estate o james lawrence o noo orleens lately deceased then bonsor comes to me shows me the order and demands that fifteen hundred \" didn t he tell you you could keep all the rest o lawrence s stuff asked the bonsorite mcginty disdained to answer this thrust but i knows my dooty as city marshal and i says no and bonsor says says he if you can t git the idee o that fifteen hundred dollars out o your head i ll git it out fur ye with a bullet an he draws on me an mcginty weakens laughed the mocker behind the stove pipe bonsor jest pockets the pore dead man s cash says mcginty with righteous indignation \"and i ve called this yer meetin t arbitrate the matter \" mino k doesn t mind arbitrating says keith low to the colonel \"but there isn t a man in camp that would give five cents for the interest of the heirs of lawrence in that fifteen hundred dollars \" a hammering on the clerk s little table announced that it was seven p m the court then called for the complaint filed by mcginty v bonsor the first case on the docket the clerk had just risen when the door was flung open and hatless coatless face aflame maudie stood among the miners boys said she on the top of a scream \"i been robbed \" hey robbed golly maudie robbed they spoke all together everybody had jumped up while we was on that stampede yesterday somebody found my all my she choked and her eyes filled \"boys my nuggets my dust my dollars they re gone \" where did you have em in a little place under in a hole her face twitched and she put her hand up to hide it mean shame dirt mean we ll find him maudie an when we do we ll hang him on the cottonwood did anybody know where you kept your i didn t think so unless it was no she screamed hysterically and then fell into weak crying \"can t think who could have been such a skunk \" but who do you suspect persisted the judge how do i know she retorted angrily \"i suspect everybody till till i know \" she clenched her hands that a thief should be \"operating\" in mino k on somebody who wasn t dead yet was a matter that came home to the business and the bosoms of all the men in the camp in the midst of the babel of speculation and excitement maudie still crying and talking incoherently about skunks opened the door the men crowded after her nobody suggested it but the entire miners meeting with one accord adjourned to the scene of the crime only a portion could be accommodated under maudie s roof but the rest crowded in front of her door or went and examined the window maudie s log cabin was a cheerful place its one room neatly kept lined throughout with red and white drill hung with marten and fox carpeted with wolf and caribou the single sign of disorder was that the bed was pulled out a little from its place in the angle of the wall above the patent condenser stove behind the oil tank where the patent condensation of oil into gas went on tiers of shelves enamelled pots and pans ranged below dishes and glasses above on the very top like a frieze gaily labelled ranks of \"tinned goods \" on the table under the window a pair of gold scales a fire burned in the stove the long lingering sunlight poured through the \"turkey red\" that she had tacked up for a half curtain and over this one saw the slouch hats and fur caps of the outside crowd clutching judge corey by the arm maudie pulled him after her into the narrow space behind the head board and the wall it was here see she stooped down some of the men pulled the bed farther out so that they too could pass round and see this piece o board goes down so slick you d never know it lifted out she fitted it in with shaking hands and then with her nails and a hairpin got it out \"and way in underneath i had this box i always set it on a flat stone \" she spoke as if this oversight were the thief s chief crime \"see like that \" she fitted the cigar box into unseen depths of space and then brought it out again wet and muddy the ground was full of springs hereabouts and the thaw had loosed them boys she stood up and held out the box \"boys it was full \" eloquently she turned it upside down how much do you reckon you had she handed the muddy box to the nearest sympathiser sat down on the fur covered bed and wiped her eyes any idea i weighed it all over again after i got in from the gold nugget the night we went on the stampede as she sobbed out the list of her former possessions judge corey took it down on the back of a dirty envelope so many ounces of dust so many in nuggets so much in bills and coin gold and silver each item was a stab yes all that all that she jumped up wildly \"and it s gone but we got to find it what you hangin round here for why if you boys had any natchral spunk you d have the thief strung up by now \" we got to find him fust you won t find him standin here they conferred afresh it must have been somebody who knowed where you kept the stuff n no her red eyes wandered miserably restlessly to the window over the red half curtain french charlie and butts looked in they had not been to the meeting maudie s face darkened as she caught sight of the canadian oh yes you can crow over me now she shouted shrilly above the buzz of comment and suggestion the canadian led the way round to the door and the two men crowded in you just get out maudie cried in a fury \"didn t i turn you out o this and tell you never \" hol on said french charlie in a conciliatory tone \"this true bout your losin \" yes it s true but i ain t askin your sympathy he stopped short and frowned course not when you can get his under his slouch hat he glowered at the colonel maudie broke into a volley of abuse the very air smelt of brimstone when finally through sheer exhaustion she dropped on the side of the bed the devil prompted french charlie to respond in kind she jumped up and turned suddenly round upon corey speaking in a voice quite different low and hoarse \"you asked me judge if anybody knew where i kept my stuff charlie did \" the canadian stopped in the middle of a lurid remark and stared stupidly the buzz died away the cabin was strangely still wasn t you along with the rest up to idaho bar inquired the judge in a friendly voice y yes not when we all were no maudie s tear washed eyes were regaining a dangerous brightness \"i wanted him to come with me he wouldn t and we quarrelled \" we didn t you didn t quarrel put in the judge we did said maudie breathless not about that it was because she wanted another feller to come too again he shot an angry glance at the kentuckian and charlie said if i gave the other feller the tip he wouldn t come and he d get even with me if it took a leg well it looks like he done it can t you prove an alibi thought you said you was along with the rest to idaho bar suggested windy jim so i was i didn t see you maudie flashed when were you there asked the judge last night oh yes when everybody else was comin home you all know if that s the time charlie usually goes on a stampede you if words could slay maudie would have dropped dead riddled with a dozen mortal wounds but she lived to reply in kind charlie s abandonment of coherent defence was against him while he wallowed blindly in a mire of offensive epithet his fellow citizens came to dark conclusions he had an old score to pay off against maudie they all knew that had he chosen this way what other so effectual he might even say most of that dust was his anyway but it was an alarming precedent the fire of maudie s excitement had caught and spread eve the less inflammable muttered darkly that it was all up with mino k if a person couldn t go on a stampede without havin his dust took out of his cabin the crowd was pressing charlie and twenty cross questions were asked him in a minute he beside himself with rage or fear or both lost all power except to curse the judge seemed to be taking down damning evidence on the dirty envelope some were suggesting bring him over to the court yes try him straight away no thumb jack was heard above the din saying it was all gammon wasting time over a trial or even in a plain case like this for the judge to require the usual complaint made in writing and signed by three citizens two men laid hold of the canadian and he turned ghastly white under his tan me me tief you let me alone he began to struggle his terrified eyes rolling round the little cabin fell on butts i don know but one tief in min ok he said wildly like a man wandering in a fever and unconscious of having spoken till he noticed there was a diversion of some sort people were looking at butts a sudden inspiration pierced the canadian s fog of terror you know what butts done to jack mcquestion you ain t forgot how he sneaked jack s watch the incident was historic every eye on butts charlie caught up breath and courage an t odder night w en maudie treat me like she done he shot a blazing glance at the double dyed traitor \"i fixed it up with butts got him to go soft on er and nab er ring \" you didn t shouted maudie with a shaking finger charlie pointed out jimmie the cashier didn t i tell you to weigh me out twenty dollars for butts that night right says jimmie it was to square butts fur gittin that ring away from maudie you put up a job like that on me to be fooled publicly was worse than being robbed charlie paid no heed to her quivering wrath the menace of the cotton wood gallows outrivalled even maudie and her moods why should i pay butts twenty dollars if i could work dat racket m self if i want expert work i go to a man like butts who knows his business i m a miner like the rest o yer the centre of gravity had shifted it was very grave indeed in the neighbourhood of mr butts hold on said the judge forcing his way nearer to the man whose fingers had a renown so perilous \" cause a man plays a trick about a girl s ring don t prove he stole her money this thing happened while the town was emptied out on the little min ok trail didn t you go off with the rest yesterday morning \" no ha gasped maudie as though this were conclusive \"had business in town did you \" mr butts declined to answer you thought the gold mine out on the gulch could wait and the gold mine in my cabin couldn t you lie remarked mr butts what time did you get to idaho bar asked corey didn t get there at all where were you here in rampart what wait wait commanded the judge as the crowd rocked towards butts p raps you ll tell us what kept you at home butts shut his mouth angrily but a glance at the faces nearest him made him think an answer prudent i was tired the men many of them ailing who had nearly killed themselves to get to idaho bar sneered openly i d been jumpin a claim up at hunter so had charlie but he joined the new stampede in the afternoon well i didn t why even the old cripple jansen went on this stampede can t help that mr butts you re the only able bodied white man in the district that stayed at home corey spoke in his most judicial style mr butts must have felt the full significance of so suspicious a fact but all he said was y ought to fix up a notice anybody that don t join a stampede will be held guilty o grand larceny saying this butts had backed a step behind the stove pipe and with incredible quickness had pulled out a revolver but before he had brought it into range no thumb jack had struck his arm down and two or three had sprung at the weapon and wrested it away search him no tellin what else he s got and he s so damned handy search him maudie pressed forward as the pinioned man s pockets were turned out only tobacco a small buckskin bag with less than four ounces of dust a pipe and a knife likely he d be carrying my stuff about on him said she contemptuous of her own keen interest get out a warrant to search butts premises said a voice in the crowd mcginty and johnson are down there now think he d leave anything layin round maudie pressed still closer to the beleaguered butts say if i make the boys let you go back to circle will you tell me where you ve hid my money ain t got your money look at im whispered charlie still so terrified he could hardly stand butts ain t borrowin no trouble and this formulating of the general impression did butts no good as they had watched the calm demeanour of the man under suspicion of what was worse in their eyes than murder there had come over the bystanders a wave of that primitive cruelty that to this hour will wake in modern men and cry as loud as in judean days or in the saga times of iceland \"retribution let him suffer let him pay in blood \" and here again on the yukon that need of visible atonement to right the crazy injustice of the earth even the women the others had crowded in were eager for butts instant expiation of the worst crime such a community knows they told one another excitedly how they d realised all along it was only a question of time before butts would be tryin his game up here nobody was safe luckily they were on to him but look he didn t care a curse it would be a good night s job to make him care three men had hold of him and everybody talked at once minnie bryan was sure she had seen him skulking round maudie s after that lady had gone up the trail but everybody had been too excited about the stampede to notice particularly the judge and bonsor were shouting and gesticulating butts answering bitterly but quietly still his face was pretty grim but it looked as if he were the one person in the place who hadn t lost his head maudie was still crying at intervals and advertising to the newcomers that wealth she had hitherto kept so dark and between whiles she stared fixedly at butts as conviction of his guilt deepened to a rage to see him suffer for his crime she would rather have her nuggets back but failing that let butts pay he owed her six thousand dollars let him pay the miners were hustling him to the door to the court house or to the cotton wood a toss up which look here cried out the colonel \"mcginty and johnson haven t got back \" nobody listened justice had been sufficiently served in sending them they had forced butts out across the threshold the crowd packed close behind the only men who had not pressed forward were keith the colonel and the boy and no thumb jack still standing by the oil tank what are they going to do with him the colonel turned to keith with horror in his face keith s eyes were on the boy who had stooped and picked up the block of wood that had fitted over the treasure hole he was staring at it with dilated eyes sharply he turned his head in the direction where no thumb jack had stood jack was just making for the door on the heels of the last of those pressing to get out the boy s low cry was drowned in the din he lunged forward but the colonel gripped him looking up he saw that kentucky understood and meant somehow to manage the business quietly jack was trying now right now left to force his way through the congestion at the door like a harried rabbit at a wattled fence a touch on the shoulder simultaneously with the click of a trigger at his ear brought his face round over his shoulder he made the instinctive pioneer motion to his hip looked into the bore of the colonel s pistol and under keith s grip dropped his \"gun hand\" with a smothered oath or was it that other weapon in the colonel s left that bleached the ruddy face simply the block of wood on the under side dried in like a faint stain four muddy finger prints index joint lacking without a word the colonel turned the upper side out a smudge no the grain of human skin clean printed a distorted palm without a thumb only one man in min ok could make that sign manual the last of the crowd were over the threshold now and still no word was spoken by those who stayed behind till the colonel said to the boy go with em and look after butts give us five minutes more if you can he laid the block on a cracker box and keeping pistol and eye still on the thief took his watch in his left hand as the boy shot through the door butts was making a good fight for his life but he was becoming exhausted the leading spirits were running him down the bank to where a crooked cotton wood leaned cautiously over the never know what as if to spy out the river s secret but after arriving there they were a little delayed for lack of what they called tackle they sent a man off for it and then sent another to hurry up the man the boy stood at the edge of the crowd a little above them watching maudie s door and with feverish anxiety turning every few seconds to see how it was with butts up in the cabin no thumb jack had pulled out of the usual capacious pockets of the miner s brown duck pockets that fasten with a patent snap a tattered pocket book fat with bills he plunged deeper and brought up pacific coast eagles and five dollar pieces canadian and american gold that went rolling out of his maimed and nervous hand across the tablet to the scales and set the brass pans sawing up and down keith his revolver still at full cock had picked up a trampled bit of paper near the stove corey s list left handedly he piled up the money counting comparing quick the dust ordered the colonel out of a left hip pocket a long tight packed buckskin bag another from a side pocket half the size and a quarter as full that s mine said jack and made a motion to recover let it alone turn out everything nuggets a miner s chamois belt unbuckled and flung heavily down the scales jingled and rocked every pocket in the belt was stuffed where s the rest there ain t any rest that s every damned pennyweight maybe we ought to weigh it and see if he s lying fore god it s all let me go he had kept looking through the crack of the door reckon it s about right said keith tain t right there s more there n i took my stuff s there too for christ s sake let me go look here jack is the little bag yours jack wet his dry lips and nodded \"yes \" the colonel snatched up the smaller bag and thrust it into the man s hands jack made for the door the colonel stopped him better take to the woods he said with a motion back towards the window the colonel opened the half closed door and looked out as jack pushed aside the table tore away the red curtain hammered at the sash then desperate set his shoulder at it and forced the whole thing out he put his maimed hand on the sill and vaulted after the shattered glass they could see him going like the wind up towards his own shack at the edge of the wood looking back once or twice doubling and tacking to keep himself screened by the haphazard hillside cabins out of sight of the lynchers down at the river will you stay with this the colonel had asked keith hurriedly nodding at the treasure covered table and catching up the finger marked block before jack was a yard from the window yes keith had said revolver still in hand and eyes on the man min ok was to see no more the colonel met the boy running breathless up the bank can t hold em any longer he shouted \"you re takin it pretty easy while a man s gettin killed down here \" stop wait the colonel floundered madly through the slush and mud calling and gesticulating \"i ve got the thief \" presto all the backs of heads became faces got the money screamed maudie uncovering her eyes she had gone to the execution but after the rope was brought her nerve failed her and she was sobbing hysterically into her two palms held right over her eyes oh you had it did you called out mcginty with easy insolence look here the colonel held up the bit of flooring with rapid explanation where is he got him locked up everybody talked at once the colonel managed to keep them going for some moments before he admitted reckon he s lit out and then the colonel got it hot and strong for his clumsiness which way d he go the colonel turned his back to the north pole and made a fine large gesture in the general direction of the equator where s my money up in your cabin better go and count it a good many were willing to help since they d been cheated out of a hanging and even defrauded of a shot at a thief on the wing nobody seemed to care to remain in the neighbourhood of the crooked cotton wood the crowd was dispersing somewhat sheepishly nobody looked at butts and yet he was a sight to see his face and his clothes were badly mauled he was covered with mud and blood when the men were interrupted in trying to get the noose over his head he had stood quite still in the midst of the crowd till it broke and melted away from him he looked round passed his hand over his eyes threw open his torn coat and felt in his pockets who s got my tobacco says he several men turned back suddenly and several pouches were held out but nobody met butts eyes he filled his pipe nor did his hand shake any more than those that held the tobacco bags when he had lit up who s got my smith and wesson he called out to the backs of the retiring citizens windy jim stood and delivered butts walked away to his cabin swaying a little as if he d had more hootch than he could carry what would you have said demanded the boy \"if you d hung the wrong man \" said echoed mcginty \"why we d a said that time the corpse had the laugh on us \" a couple of hours later keith put an excited face into his shack where the colonel and the boy were just crawling under their blankets thought you might like to know that miners meeting that was interrupted is having an extra session they followed him down to the court through a fine rain the night was heavy and thick as they splashed along keith explained of course charlie knew there wasn t room enough in alaska now for butts and him and he thought he d better send butts home so he took his gun and went to call don t tell me that poor devil s killed after all not a bit butts is a little bunged up but he s the handier man even so he drew the first bead charlie hurt no he isn t hurt he s dead three or four fellows had just looked in on the quiet to kind of apologise to butts they re down at corey s now givin evidence against him so butts ll have to swing after all is he in court yes been a busy day for butts a confused noise came suddenly out of the big cabin they were nearing they opened the door with difficulty and forced their way into the reeking crowded room for the second time that night everybody seemed to be talking nobody listening dimly through dense clouds of tobacco smoke \"the prisoner at the bar\" was seen to be what no yes shaking hands with the judge verdict already oh that kind o case don t take a feller like corey long what s the decision prisoner discharged charlie le gros committed suicide suicide by goin with his gun to butts shack lookin f trouble chapter xix the ice goes out i am apart of all that i have seen it had been thawing and freezing freezing and thawing for so long that men lost account of the advance of a summer coming with such balked uncertain steps indeed the weather variations had for several weeks been so great that no journey not the smallest could be calculated with any assurance the last men to reach mino k were two who had made a hunting and prospecting trip to an outlying district they had gone there in six days and were nineteen in returning the slush was waist deep in the gulches on the benches in the snow holes appeared as though red hot stones had been thrown upon the surface the little settlement by the mouth of the mino k sat insecurely on the boggy hillside and its inhabitants waded knee deep in soaking tundra moss and mire and now down on the never know what water was beginning to run on the marginal ice up on the mountains the drifted snow was honey combed whole fields of it gave way and sunk a foot under any adventurous shoe but although these changes had been wrought slowly with backsets of bitter nights when everything was frozen hard as flint the illusion was general that summer came in with a bound on the th of may mino k went to bed in winter and woke to find the snow almost gone under the last nineteen hours of hot unwinking sunshine and the first geese winging their way up the valley sight to stir men s hearts stranger still the eight months arctic silence broken suddenly by a thousand voices under every snow bank a summer murmur very faint at first but hourly louder the sound of falling water softly singing over all the land as silence had been the distinguishing feature of the winter so was noise the sign of the spring no ear so dull but now was full of it all the brooks on all the hills tinkling tumbling babbling of some great and universal joy all the streams of all the gulches joining with every little rill to find the old way or to carve a new back to the father of waters and the strange thing had happened on the yukon the shore edges of the ice seemed sunken and the water ran yet deeper there but of a certainty the middle part had risen the cheechalkos thought it an optical illusion but old brandt from forty mile had seen the ice go out for two and twenty years and he said it went out always so \"humps his back an gits up gits and when he s a gitten jest look out \" those who in spite of warning ventured in hip boots down on the never know what found that in places the under side of the ice was worn nearly through if you bent your head and listened you could plainly hear that greater music of the river running underneath low as yet but deep and strangely stirring dominating in the hearer s ears all the clear high clamour from gulch and hill in some men s hearts the ice \"went out\" at the sound and the melting welled up in their eyes summer and liberty were very near oh hurry yukon inua let the ice go out and let the boats come in but the next few days hung heavily the river ice humped its back still higher but showed no disposition to \"git \" the wonder was it did not crack under the strain but northern ice ahs the air of being strangely flexile several feet in depth the water ran now along the margin more geese and ducks appeared and flocks of little birds canada jays robins joined the swelling chorus of the waters oh hurry hurry inua and open the great highway not at min ok alone at every wood camp mining town and mission at every white post and indian village all along the yukon groups were gathered waiting the great moment of the year no one had ever heard of the ice breaking up before the th of may or later than the th and yet men had begun to keep a hopeful eye on the river from the th of april when a white ptarmigan was reported wearing a collar of dark brown feathers and his wings tipped brown that was a month ago and the great moment could not possibly be far now the first thing everybody did on getting up and the last thing everybody did on going to bed was to look at the river it was not easy to go to bed and even if you got so far it was not easy to sleep the sun poured into the cabins by night as well as by day and there was nothing to divide one part of the twenty four hours from another you slept when you were too tired to watch the river you breakfasted like as not at six in the evening you dined at midnight through all your waking hours you kept an eye on the window overlooking the river in your bed you listened for that ancient yukon cry \"the ice is going out \" for ages it had meant to the timid beware the fury of the shattered ice fields beware the caprice of the flood watch lest many lives go out with the ice as aforetime and for ages to the stout hearted it had meant make ready the kyaks and the birch canoes see that tackle and traps are strong for plenty or famine wait upon the hour as the white men waited for boats to day the men of the older time had waited for the salmon for those first impatient adventurers that would force their way under the very ice jam tenderest and best of the season s catch as eager to prosecute that journey from the ocean to the klondyke as if they had been men marching after the gold boom no one could settle to anything it was by fits and starts that the steadier hands indulged even in target practice with a feverish subconsciousness that events were on the way that might make it inconvenient to have lost the art of sending a bullet straight after a diminutive tin can hung on a tree had been made to jump at a hundred paces the marksman would glance at the river and forget to fire it was by fits and starts that they even drank deeper or played for higher stakes the wheel of fortune in the gold nugget was in special demand it was a means of trying your luck with satisfactory despatch \"between drinks\" or between long bouts of staring at the river men stood in shirt sleeves at their cabin doors in the unwinking sunshine looking up the valley or down betting that the \"first boat in\" would be one of those nearest neighbours may west or muckluck coming up from woodworth others as ready to back heavily their opinion that the first blast of the steam whistle would come down on the flood from circle or from dawson the colonel had bought and donned a new suit of \"store clothes and urged on his companion the necessity of at least a whole pair of breeches in honour of his entrance into the klondyke but the boy s funds were low and his vanity chastened besides he had other business on his mind after sending several requests for the immediate return of his dog requests that received no attention the boy went out to the gulch to recover him nig s new master paid up all arrears of wages readily enough but declined to surrender the dog oh no the ice wasn t thinkin o goin out yit \" i want my dog you ll git him sure i m glad you understand that much i ll bring him up to rampart in time for the first boat where s my dog no answer the boy whistled no nig dread masked itself in choler he jumped on the fellow forced him down and hammered him till he cried for mercy where s my dog then he he s up to idyho bar whimpered the prostrate one and there the boy found him staggering under a pair of saddle bags hired out to mike o reilly for a dollar and a half a day together they returned to rampart to watch for the boat certainly the ice was very late breaking up this year the men of rampart stood about in groups in the small hours of the morning of the th of may as usual smoking yarning speculating inventing elaborate joshes somebody remembered that certain cheechalkos had gone to bed at midnight now this was unprecedented even impertinent if the river is not open by the middle of may your sour dough may go to bed only he doesn t still he may do as he lists but your cheechalko why this is the hour of his initiation it was as if a man should yawn at his marriage or refuse to sleep at his funeral the offenders were some of those woodworth fellows who with a dozen or so others had built shacks below \"the street\" yet well above the river at two in the morning sour dough saunders knocked them up the ice is goin out in a flash the sleepers stood at the door only a josh one showed fight well it s true what i m tellin yer persisted saunders seriously the ice is goin out and it s goin soon and when you re washed out o yer bunks ye needn t blame me fur i warned yer you don t mean the flood ll come up here mebbe you ve arranged so she won t this year the cheechalkos consulted in the end four of them occupied the next two hours to the infinite but masked amusement of the town in floundering about in the mud setting up tents in the boggy wood above the settlement and with much pains transporting thither as many of their possessions as they did not lose in the bottomless pit of the mire when the business was ended min ok self control gave way the cheechalkos found themselves the laughing stock of the town the others who had dared to build down on the bank but who \"hadn t scared worth a cent sauntered up to the gold nugget to enjoy the increased esteem of the sour doughs and the humiliation of the men who had thought the yukon was goin over the ramparts this year haw haw \" it surprises the average mind to discover that one of civilization s most delicate weapons is in such use and is so potently dreaded among the roughest frontier spirits no fine gentleman in a drawing room no sensitive girl shrinks more from what meredith calls \"the comic laugh none feels irony more keenly than your ordinary american pioneer the men who had moved up into the soaking wood saw they had run a risk as great to them as the fabled danger of the river the risk of the josher s irony the dire humiliation of the laugh if a man up here does you an injury and you kill him you haven t after all taken the ultimate revenge you might have got the laugh on him and let him live to hear it while all min ok was jollying\" the woodworth men maudie made one of her sudden raids out of the gold nugget she stood nearly up to the knees of her high rubber boots in the bog of \"main street talking earnestly with the colonel keith and the boy sitting on a store box outside of the saloon had looked on at the fun over the timid cheechalkos and looked on now at maudie and the colonel it crossed the boy s mind that they d be putting up a josh on his pardner pretty soon and at the thought he frowned keith had been saying that the old miners had nearly all got squawed \" he had spoken almost superstitiously of the queer lasting effect of the supposedly temporary arrangement no they don t leave their wives as often as you d expect but in most cases it seems to kill the pride of the man he gives up all idea of ever going home and even if he makes a fortune they say he stays on here and year by year he sinks lower and lower till he s farther down in the scale of things human than his savage wife yes it s awful to think how the life up here can take the stiffening out of a fella he looked darkly at the two out there in the mud keith nodded strong men have lain down on the trail this winter and cried but it wasn t that sort of thing the other meant keith followed his new friend s glowering looks yes that s just the kind of man that gets taken in what said the boy brusquely just the sort that goes and marries some flighty creature well said his pardner haughtily \"he could afford to marry a flighty creature the colonel s got both feet on the ground \" and keith felt properly snubbed but what maudie was saying to the colonel was you re goin up in the first boat i s pose yes looks like i ll be the only person left in min ok i don t imagine you ll be quite alone no why there s only between five and six hundred expectin to board a boat that ll be crowded before she gets here does everybody want to go to dawson everybody except a few boomers who mean to stay long enough to play off their misery on someone else before they move on the colonel looked a trifle anxious i hadn t thought of that i suppose there will be a race for the boat there ll be a race all the way up the river for all the early boats ain t half enough to carry the people but you look to me like you ll stand as good a chance as most and anyhow you re the one man i know i ll trust my dough to the colonel stared you see i want to get some money to my kiddie an besides i got m self kind o scared about keepin dust in my cabin i want it in a bank so s if i should kick the bucket there ll be some pretty high rollin here when there s been a few boats in and my life s no better than any other feller s i d feel a lot easier if i knew the kiddie d have six thousand clear even if i did turn up my toes see a yes i see but the door of the cabin next the saloon opened suddenly a graybeard with a young face came out rubbing the sleep from his eyes he stared interrogatively at the river and then to the world in general what time is it half past four mornin or evenin and no one thought the question strange maudie lowered her voice no need to mention it to pardners and people you don t want every feller to know you re goin about loaded but will you take my dust up to dawson and get it sent to frisco on the first boat the ice the ice it s moving the ice is going out look the ice from end to end of the settlement the cry was taken up people darted out of cabins like beavers out of their burrows three little half breed indian boys yelling with excitement tore past the gold nugget crying now in their mother s min ok now in their father s english \"the ice is going out \" from the depths of the store box whereon his master had sat nig darted howling excitedly and waving a muddy tail like a draggled banner saying in mahlemeut \"the ice is going out the fish are coming in \" all the other dogs waked and gave tongue running in and out among the huddled rows of people gathered on the ramparts every ear full of the rubbing grinding noise that came up out of the yukon noise not loud but deep an undercurrent of heavy sound as they stood there wide eyed gaping their solid winter world began to move a compact mass of ice three quarters of a mile wide and four miles long with a great grinding and crushing went down the valley some distance below the town it jammed building with incredible quickness a barrier twenty feet high the people waited breathless again the ice mass trembled but the watchers lifted their eyes to the heights above was that thunder in the hills no the ice again again crushing grinding to the low accompaniment of thunder that seemed to come from far away sections a mile long and half a mile wide were forced up carried over the first ice pack and summarily stopped below the barrier huge pieces broken off from the sides came crunching their way angrily up the bank as if acting on some independent impulse there they sat great fragments glistening in the sunlight as big as cabins it was something to see them come walking up the shelving bank the cheechalkos who laughed before are contented now with running leaving their goods behind sour dough saunders himself never dreamed the ice would push its way so far in mid channel a still unbroken sheet is bent yet more in the centre every now and then a wide crack opens near the margin and the water rushes out with a roar once more the mass is nearly still and now all s silent not till the water dammed and thrown back by the ice not until it rises many feet and comes down with a volume and momentum irresistible will the final conflict come hour after hour the people stand there on the bank waiting to see the barrier go down unwillingly as the time goes on this one that one hurries away for a few minutes to prepare and devour a meal back again breathless upon rumour of that preparatory trembling that strange thrilling of the ice the grinding and the crushing had begun again the long tension the mysterious sounds the sense of some great unbridled power at work wrought on the steadiest nerves people did the oddest things down at the lower end of the town a couple of miners sick of the scurvy had painfully clambered on their roof whether to see the sights or be out of harm s way no one knew the stingiest man in min ok who had refused to help them in their cabin carried them food on the roof a woman made and took them the yukon remedy for their disease they sat in state in sight of all men and drank spruce tea by one o clock in the afternoon the river had risen eight feet but the ice barrier still held the people worn out went away to sleep all that night the barrier held though more ice came down and still the water rose twelve feet now the ranks of shattered ice along the shore are claimed again as the flood widens and licks them in the cheechalkos cabins are flooded to the caves stout fellows in hip boots take a boat and rescue the scurvy stricken from the roof and still the barrier held people began to go about their usual avocations the empty gold nugget filled again men sat as they had done all the winter drinking and reading the news of eight months before out of soiled and tattered papers late the following day everyone started up at a new sound again miners indians and dogs lined the bank saw the piled ice masses tremble heard a crashing and grinding as of mountains of glass hurled together saw the barrier give way and the frozen wastes move down on the bosom of the flood higher yet the water rose the current ran eight miles an hour and now the ice masses were less enormous more broken somewhere far below another jam another long bout of waiting birds are singing everywhere between the white snowdrifts the arctic moss shows green and yellow white flowers star the hills half the town is packed ready to catch the boat at five minutes notice with door barred and red curtain down maudie is doing up her gold dust for the colonel to take to dawson the man who had washed it out of a birch creek placer and \"blowed it in fur the girl\" up on the hillside he sleeps sound the two who had broken the record for winter travel on the yukon side by side in the sunshine on a plank laid across two mackerel firkins sit and watch the brimming flood they speak of the big chimney men picture them packed and waiting for the oklahoma wonder what they have done with kaviak and what the three months have brought them when we started out that day from the big chimney we thought we d be made if only we managed to reach min ok well we ve got what we came for each got a claim oh yes a good claim too guess so don t you know the gold s there yes but where are the miners you and i don t propose to spend the next ten years in gettin that gold out no but there are plenty who would if we gave em the chance all we have to do is to give the right ones the chance the colonel wore an air of reflection the district will be opened up the boy went on cheerfully \"and we ll have people beggin us to let em get out our gold and givin us the lion s share for the privilege \" do you altogether like the sound o that i expect like other people i ll like the result we ought to see some things clearer than other people we had our lesson on the trail said the colonel quietly \"nobody ought ever to be able to fool us about the power and the value of the individual apart from society seems as if association did make value in the absence of men and markets a pit full of gold is worth no more than a pit full of clay \" oh yes i admit till the boats come in we re poor men nobody will stop here this summer they ll all be racing on to dawson dawson s it beyond a doubt the colonel laughed a little ruefully we used to say min ok i said min ok just to sound reasonable but of course i meant dawson and they sat there thinking watching the ice blocks meet crash go down in foam and come up again on the lower reaches the boy idly swinging the great katharine s medal to and fro in his buckskin pocket it has worn so bright it catches at the light like a coin fresh from the mint no doubt muckluck is on the river bank at pymeut the one eyed prince the story teller yagorsha even ol chief no one will be indoors to day sitting there together they saw the last stand made by the ice and shared that moment when the final barrier somewhere far below gave way with boom and thunder the mighty flood ran free tearing up trees by their roots as it ran detaching masses of rock dissolving islands into swirling sand and drift carving new channels making and unmaking the land the water began to fall it had been a great time it was ended pardner says the colonel \"we ve seen the ice go out \" no fella can call you and me cheechalkos after to day no sah we ve travelled the long trail we ve seen the ice go out and we re friends yet the kentuckian took his pardner s brown hand with a gentle solemnity seemed about to say something but stopped and turned his bronzed face to the flood carried back upon some sudden tide within himself to those black days on the trail that he wanted most in the world to forget but in his heart he knew that all dear things all things kind and precious his home a woman s face all all would fade before he forgot those last days on the trail the record of that journey was burnt into the brain of the men who had made it on that stretch of the long trail the elder had grown old and the younger had forever lost his youth not only had the roundness gone out of his face not only was it scarred but such lines were graven there as commonly takes the antique pencil half a score of years to trace something has happened the colonel said quite low \"we aren t the same men who left the big chimney \" right said the boy with a laugh unwilling as yet to accept his own personal revelation preferring to put a superficial interpretation on his companion s words he glanced at the colonel and his face changed a little but still he would not understand looking down at the chaparejos that he had been so proud of sadly abbreviated to make boots for nig jagged here and there and with fringes now not all intentional it suited him to pretend that the \"shaps\" had suffered most yes the ice takes the kinks out whether the thing that s happened is good or evil i don t pretend to say the other went on gravely staring at the river \"i only know something s happened there were possibilities in me anyhow that have been frozen to death yes we re different \" the boy roused himself but only to persist in his misinterpretation you ain t different to hurt if i started out again tomorrow the lord forbid amen but if i had to you re the only man in alaska in the world i d want for my pardner boy he wrestled with a slight bronchial huskiness cleared his throat tried again and gave it up contenting himself with \"beg your pardon for callin you boy you re a seasoned old timer sah \" and the boy felt as if some sovereign had dubbed him knight in a day or two now from north or south the first boat must appear the willows were unfolding their silver leaves the alder buds were bursting geese and teal and mallard swarmed about the river margin especially where the equisetae showed the tips of their feathery green tails above the mud ducks flocked and feasted people were too excited \"too busy they said looking for the boats to do much shooting the shy birds waxed daring keith standing by his shack knocked over a mallard within forty paces of his door it was eight days after that first cry the ice is going out \" four since the final jam gave way and let the floes run free that at one o clock in the afternoon the shout went up \"a boat a boat \" only a lumberman s bateau but two men were poling her down the current with a skill that matched the speed they swung her in a dozen hands caught at the painter and made fast a young man stepped ashore and introduced himself as van alen benham s \"upper river pardner on the way to anvik \" his companion donovan was from circle city and brought appalling news the boats depended on for the early summer traffic bella and three other n a t and t steamers as well as the a c s victoria and the st michael had been lifted up by the ice \"like so many feathers forced clean out of the channel and left high and dry on a sandy ridge with an ice wall eighty feet wide and fifteen high between them and open water all the crews hard at work with jackscrews said donovan and if they can get skids under and a channel blasted through the ice they may get the boats down here in fifteen or twenty days \" a heavy blow but instantly everyone began to talk of the may west and the muckluck as though all along they had looked for succour to come up stream rather than down but as the precious hours passed a deep dejection fastened on the camp there had been a year when through one disaster after another no boats had got to the upper river not even the arrival from dawson of the montana kid pugilist and gambler could raise spirits so cast down not even though he was said to bring strange news from outside there was war in the world down yonder war had been formally declared between america and spain windy slapped his thigh in humourous despair why hadn t he thought o gettin off a josh like that to those who listened to the montana kid to the fretted spirits of men eight months imprisoned the states and her foreign affairs were far away indeed and as for the other party to the rumoured war spain they clutched at school memories of columbus americans finding through him the way to spain as through him spaniards had found the way to america so spain was not merely a state historic she was still in the active world but what did these things matter boats mattered the place where the klondykers were caught this min ok mattered and so did the place they wanted to reach dawson mattered most of all by the narrowed habit of long months dawson was the centre of the universe more little boats going down and still nothing going up men said gloomily we re done for the fellows who go by the canadian route will get everything the dawson season will be half over before we re in the field if we ever are the th of may still no steamer had come but the mosquitoes had bloodthirsty beyond any the temperate climates know it was clear that some catastrophe had befallen the woodworth boats and nig had been lured away by his quondam master no they had not gone back to the gulch that was too easy the man had a mind to keep the dog and since he was not allowed to buy him he would do the other thing he had not been gone an hour rumour said had taken a scow and provisions and dropped down the river utterly desperate the boy seized his new nulato gun and somebody else s canoe without so much as inquiring whose he shot down the swift current after the dog thief he roared back to the remonstrating colonel that he didn t care if an up river steamer did come while he was gone he was goin gunnin at the same time he shared the now general opinion that a lower river boat would reach them first and he was only going to meet her meting justice by the way he had gone safely more than ten miles down when suddenly as he was passing an island he stood up in his boat balanced himself and cocked his gun down there on the left a man was standing knee deep in the water trying to free his boat from a fallen tree a siwash dog watched him from the bank the boy whistled the dog threw up his nose yapped and whined the man had turned sharply saw his enemy and the levelled gun he jumped into the boat but she was filling while he bailed the dog ran along the island howling fit to raise the dead when he was a little above the boy s boat he plunged into the river nig was a good swimmer but the current here would tax the best the boy found himself so occupied with saving nig from a watery grave while he kept the canoe from capsizing that he forgot all about the thief till a turn in the river shut him out of sight the canoe was moored and while trying to restrain nig s dripping caresses his master looked up and saw something queer off there above the tops of the cottonwoods as he looked he forgot the dog forgot everything in earth or heaven except that narrow cloud wavering along the sky he sat immovable in the round shouldered attitude learned in pulling a hand sled against a gale from the pole if you are moderately excited you may start but there is an excitement that \"nails you \" nig shook his wolf s coat and sprayed the water far and wide made little joyful noises and licked the face that was so still but his master like a man of stone stared at that long gray pennon in the sky if it isn t a steamer what is it like an echo out of some lesson he had learned and long forgot \"up bound boats don t run the channel they have to hunt for easy water \" suddenly he leaped up the canoe tipped and nig went a second time into the water well for him that they were near the shore he could jump in without help this time no hand held out no eye for him his master had dragged the painter free seized the oars and saying harshly \"lie down you black devil \" he pulled back against the current with every ounce he had in him for the gray pennon was going round the other side of the island and the boy was losing the boat to dawson nig sat perkily in the bow never budging till his master running into the head of the island caught up a handful of tough root fringes and holding fast by them waved his cap and shouted like one possessed let go the fringes caught up his gun and fired then nig realising that for once in a way noise seemed to be popular pointed his nose at the big object hugging the farther shore and howled with a right goodwill they see they see hooray the boy waved his arms embraced nig then snatched up the oars the steamer s engines were reversed now she was still the boy pulled lustily a crowded ship crew and passengers pressed to the rails the steamer canted and the captain s orders rang out clear several cheechalkos laid their hands on their guns as the wild fellow in the ragged buckskins shot round the motionless wheel and brought his canoe long side while his savage looking dog still kept the echoes of the lower ramparts calling three cheers for the oklahoma at the sound of the boy s voice a red face hanging over the stern broke into a broad grin be the siven air ye the little divvle himself or air ye the divvle s gran fatherr the apparition in the canoe was making fast and preparing to board the ship can t take another passenger full up said the captain he couldn t hear what was said in reply but he shook his head \"been refusin em right along \" then as if reproached by the look in the wild young face \"we thought you were in trouble \" so i am if you won t i tell you we got every ounce we can carry oh take me back to min ok anyway he said a few words about fare to the captain s back as that magnate did not distinctly say \"no\" indeed walked off making conversation with the engineer twenty hands helped the new passenger to get nig and the canoe on board well got a gold mine asked potts yes sir where s the colonel mac rasped out with his square jaw set for judgment colonel s all right at min ok we ve got a gold mine apiece anny gowld in em yes sir and no salt neither sorry to see success has gone to your head drawled potts eyeing the boy s long hair \"i don t see any undue signs of it elsewhere \" faith i do thin he s turned wan o thim hungry grabbin millionaires what makes you think that laughed the boy poking his brown fingers through the knee hole of his breeches arre ye contint wid that gowld mine at min ok no be the siven what s wan gowld mine to a millionaire what forr wud ye be prospectin that desert oiland you and yer faithful man froyday if ye wasn t rooned intoirely be riches the boy tore himself away from his old friends and followed the arbiter of his fate the engines had started up again and they were going on i m told said the captain rather severely \"that min ok s a busted camp \" oh is it returned the ragged one cheerfully then he remembered that this captain rainey had grub staked a man in the autumn a man who was reported to know where to look for the mother lode the mighty parent of the yukon placers \"i can tell you the facts about min ok \" he followed the captain up on the hurricane deck giving him details about the new strike and the wonderful richness of idaho bar \"nobody would know about it to day but that the right man went prospecting there \" one in the eye for whoever said min ok was \"busted and another for the prospector rainey had sent to look for you see men like pitcairn have given up lookin for the mother lode they say you might as well look for mother eve you got to make out with her descendants yukon gold pitcairn says comes from an older rock series than this\" he stood in the shower of sparks constantly spraying from the smoke stack to the fireproof deck and he waved his hand airily at the red rock of the ramparts \"far older than any of these the gold up here has all come out o rock that went out o the rock business millions o years ago most o that mother lode the miners are lookin for is sand now thirteen hundred miles away in norton sound \" just my luck said the captain gloomily going a little for ard as though definitely giving up mining and returning to his own proper business but the rest o the mother lode the gold and magnetic iron was too heavy to travel that s what s linin the gold basins o the north linin idaho bar thick the captain sighed twelve a voice sang out on the lower deck twelve repeated the captain twelve echoed the pilot at the wheel twelve and a half from the man below a tall lean fellow casting the sounding pole with a rhythmic nonchalance he plants the long black and white staff at the ship s side draws it up dripping plunges it down again draws it up and sends it down hour after hour he never seems to tire he never seems to see anything but the water mark never to say anything but what he is chanting now \"twelve and a half or some variation merely numerical you come to think him as little human as the calendar only that his numbers are told off with the significance of sound the suggested menace of a cry if the sounding\" comes too near the steamer s draught or the pilot fails to hear the reading the captain repeats it he often does so when there is no need it is a form of conversation noncommittal yet smacking of authority ten ten echoed the pilot while the captain was admitting that he had been mining vicariously \"for twenty years and never made a cent always keep thinkin i ll soon be able to give up steamboatin and buy a farm \" he shook his head as one who sees his last hope fade but his ragged companion turned suddenly and while the sparks fell in a fresh shower \"well captain says he you ve got the chance of your life right now \" ten and a half just what they ve all said wish i had the money i ve wasted on grub stakin the ragged one thrust his hands in the pockets of his chaparejos i grub staked myself and i m very glad i did nobody in with you no nine echo \"nine \" ten pitcairn says somehow or other there s been gold washin goin on up here pretty well ever since the world began indians no seems to have been a bigger job than even white men could manage instead o stamp mills glaciers grindin up the mother lode instead o little sluice boxes rivers instead o riffles gravel bottoms work work wash wash day and night every summer for a million years never a clean up since the foundation of the world no sir waitin for us to do that waitin now up on idaho bar the captain looked at him trying to conceal the envy in his soul they were sounding low water but he never heard he looked round sharply as the course changed i ve done my assessment the ragged man went on joyously \"and i m going to dawson \" this was bad navigation he felt instantly he had struck a snag the captain smiled and passed on sounding \"nine and a half \" but i ve got a fortune on the bar i m not a boomer but i believe in the bar six six gettin into low water again the steamer swung out hunting a new channel pitcairn s opinion is thought a lot of the geologic survey men listen to pitcairn he helped them one year he s one of those extraordinary old miners who can tell from the look of things without even panning when he saw that pyrites on idaho bar he stopped dead this looks good to me he said and jee rusalem it was good they stared at the ramparts growing bolder the river hurrying like a mill race the steamer feeling its way slow and cautiously like a blind man with a stick seven seven seven six and a half pitcairn says gold is always thickest on the inside of an elbow or turn in the stream it s in a place like that my claim is the steamer swerved still further out from the course indicated on the chart the pilot was still hunting a new channel but still the captain stood and listened and it was not to the sounding of the yukon bar they say there s no doubt about the whole country being glaciated hey signs of glacial erosion everywhere the captain looked sharply about as if his ship might be in some new danger no doubt the gold is all concentrates oh is that so he seemed relieved on the whole eight and a half from below eight and a half from the captain eight and a half from the pilot house concentrates eh something arresting rich sounding in the news a triple essence of the perfume of riches with the incantation of technical phrase over the witch brew of adventure gambling and romance that simmers in the mind when men tell of finding gold in the ground with the addition of this salt of science comes a savour of homely virtue an aroma promising sustenance and strength it confounds suspicion and sees unbelief first weaken and at last do reverence there is something hypnotic in the terminology enthusiasm even backed by fact will scare off your practical man who yet will turn to listen to the theory of \"the mechanics of erosion\" and one of its proofs \"up there before our eyes the striation of the ramparts \" but rainey was what he called \"an old bird \" his squinted pilot eye came back from the glacier track and fell on the outlandish figure of his passenger and with an inward admiration of his quality of extreme old birdness the captain struggled against the trance didn t i hear you say something about going to dawson y yes i think dawson ll be worth seeing holy moses yes there s never been anything like dawson before and i want to talk to the big business men there i m not a miner myself i mean to put my property on the market as he said the words it occurred to him unpleasantly how very like mcginty they sounded but he went on \"i didn t dream of spending so much time up here as i ve put in already i ve got to get back to the states \" you had any proposition yet the captain led the way to his private room about my claim not yet but once i get it on the market so full was he of a scheme of his own he failed to see that he had no need to go to dawson for a buyer the captain set out drinks and still the talk was of the bar it had come now to seem impossible even to an old bird that given those exact conditions gold should not be gathered thick along that bar i regard it as a sure thing anyhow it s recorded and the assessment s done all the district wants now is capital to develop it districts like that all over the map said the old bird with a final flutter of caution \"even if the capital s found if everything s ready for work the summer s damn short but if it s a question of goin huntin for the means of workin \" there s time returned the other quietly \"but there s none to waste you take me and my pardner \" thought you didn t have a pardner snapped the other hot over such duplicity not in ownership he s got another claim but you take my pardner and me to dawson the captain stood on his legs and roared i can t i tell you you can if you will you will if you want that farm rainey gaped take us to dawson and i ll get a deed drawn up in min ok turning over one third of my idaho bar property to john r rainey john r rainey gaped the more and then finding his tongue no no i d just as soon come in on the bar but it s true what i m tellin you there simply ain t an unoccupied inch on the oklahoma this trip it s been somethin awful the way i ve been waylaid and prayed at for a passage people starvin with bags o money waitin for em at the dawson bank settlements under water men up in trees callin to us to stop for the love of god men in boats crossin our channel headin us off thinkin nothin o the risk o bein run down take us to dawson it s the cry for fifteen hundred miles oh come you stopped for me the captain smiled shrewdly i didn t think it necessary at the time to explain we d struck bottom just then new channel you know it changes a lot every time the ice goes out and the floods come down i reversed our engines and went up to talk to the pilot we backed off just after you boarded us i must have been rattled to take you even to min ok no it was the best turn you ve done yourself in a long while the captain shook his head it was true the passengers of the oklahoma were crowded like cattle on a kansas stock car he knew he ought to unload and let a good portion wait at min ok for that unknown quantity the next boat he would issue the order but that he knew it would mean a mutiny i ll get into trouble for overloading as it is you probably won t people are too busy up here if you do i m offerin you a good many thousand dollars for the risk god bless my soul where d i put you there ain t a bunk i ve slept by the week on the ice there ain t room to lie down then we ll stand up lord lord what could you do with such a man owner of idaho bar too mechanics of erosion \"concentrates a third interest\" it all rang in his head \"i ve got nine fellers sleepin in here he said helplessly in my room \" can we come if we find our own place and don t trouble you well i won t have any pardner but perhaps you oh pardner s got to come too whatever the captain said the nerve tearing shriek of the whistle drowned it was promptly replied to by the most horrible howls reckon that s nig he s got to come too said this dreadful ragged man god bless me this must be min ok the harassed captain hustled out you must wait long enough here to get that deed drawn captain called out the other as he flew down the companionway nearly six hundred people on the bank suddenly controlling his eagerness the boy contented himself with standing back and staring across strange shoulders at the place he knew so well there was \"the worst lookin shack in the town that had been his home the a c store looming importantly the gold nugget and hardly a face to which he could not give a name and a history windy jim and the crippled swede bonsor cheek by jowl with his enemy mcginty judge corey spitting straight and far the gorgeous bartender all checks and diamonds in front of a pitiful group of the scurvy stricken thirty of them in the town waiting for rescue by the steamer butts quite bland under the crooked cottonwood with never a thought of how near he had come on that very spot to missing the first boat of the year and all the boats of all the years to follow maudie keith and the colonel stood with the a c agent at the end of the baggage bordered plank walk that led to the landing behind them at least four hundred people packed and waiting with their possessions at their feet ready to be put aboard the instant the oklahoma made fast the captain had called out howdy\" to the a c agent and several greetings were shouted back and forth maudie mounted a huge pile of baggage and sat there as on a throne the colonel and keith perching on a heap of gunny sacks at her feet that woman almost the only person in sight who did not expect by means of the oklahoma to leave misery behind the boy stood thinking \"how will they bear it when they know \" the oklahoma was late but she was not only the first boat she might conceivably be the last potts and o flynn had spotted the man they were looking for and called out \"hello hello \" as the big fellow on the pile of gunnies got up and waved his hat mac leaned over the rail saying gruffly \"that you colonel \" trying as the boss of the big chimney saw \"tryin his darndest not to look pleased and all the while o flynn was waving his hat and howling with excitement how s the gowld how s yersilf \" the gangway began its slow swing round preparatory to lowering into place the mob on shore caught up boxes bundles bags and pressed forward no no stand back ordered the captain take your time said people trembling with excitement \"there s no rush \" there s no room called out the purser to a friend no room went from mouth to mouth incredulous that the information could concern the speaker he was only one there was certainly room for him and every man pushed the harder to be the sole exception to the dreadful verdict stand back there can t take even a pound of freight loaded to the guards a whirlwind of protest and appeal died away in curses women wept and sick men turned away their faces the dogs still howled for nothing is so lacerating to the feelings of your siwash as a steam whistle blast the memory of it troubles him long after the echo of it dies suddenly above the din maudie s shrill voice i thought that was nig before the gangway had dropped with a bang her sharp eyes had picked out the boy well i ll be see who that is behind nig trust him to get in on the ground floor he ain t worryin for fear his pardner ll lose the boat she called to the colonel who was pressing forward as rainey came down the gangway how do you do captain the man addressed never turned his head he was forcing his way through the jam up to the a c store you may recall me sah i am if you are a man wantin to go to dawson it doesn t matter who you are i can t take you but sah it was no use a dozen more were pushing their claims every one in vain the oklahoma passengers bent on having a look at min ok crowded after the captain among those who first left the ship the boy talking to the purser hard upon rainey s heels the colonel stood there as they passed the captain turning back to say something to the boy and then they disappeared together through the door of the a c never a word for his pardner not so much as a look bitterness fell upon the colonel s heart maudie called to him and he went back to his seat on the gunny sacks he s in with the captain now she said \"he s got no more use for us \" but there was less disgust than triumph in her face o flynn was walking over people in his frantic haste to reach the colonel before he could accomplish his design he had three separate quarrels on his hands and was threatening with fury to \"settle the hash\" of several of his dearest new friends potts meanwhile was shaking the big chimney boss by the hand and saying \"awfully sorry we can t take you on with us \" adding lower \"we had a mighty mean time after you lit out \" then mac thrust his hand in between the two and gave the colonel a monkey wrench grip that made the kentuckian s eyes water kaviak well i ll tell you he shouldered potts out of his way and while the talk and movement went on all round maudie s throne mac ignoring her set forth grimly how after an awful row with potts he had adventured with kaviak to holy cross \"an awful row indeed thought the colonel to bring mac to that \" but the circumstances had little interest for him beside the fact that his pardner would be off to dawson in a few minutes leaving him behind and caring \"not a sou markee \" mac was still at holy cross he had seen a woman there \"calls herself a nun evidently swallows those priests whole kind of mad believes it all except for that good sort of girl the kind to keep her word\" and she had promised to look after kaviak and never let him away from her till mac came back to fetch him fetch him fetch him fetch him where home when will that be just as soon as i ve put through the job up yonder he jerked his head up the river indicating the common goal and now o flynn roaring as usual had broken away from those who had obstructed his progress and had flung himself upon the colonel when the excitement had calmed down a little \"well said the colonel to the three ranged in front of him maudie looking on from above what you been doin all these three months \" doin well a oh we done a lot

followed the captain out of the a c store all the motley crew that had swarmed off to inspect min ok swarmed back upon the oklahoma the boy left the captain this time and came briskly over to his friends who were taking leave of the colonel so you re all goin on but me said the colonel very sadly the colonel s pardner stopped short and looked at the pile of baggage got your stuff all ready he said yes the answer was not free from bitterness \"i ll have the pleasure of packin it back to the shack after you re gone \" so you were all ready to go off and leave me said the boy the colonel could not stoop to the obvious retort his pardner came round the pile and his eyes fell on their common sleeping bag the two nulato rifles and other \"traps that meant more to him than any objects inanimate in all the world what you were goin to carry off my things too \" exclaimed the boy that s all you get maudie burst out indignantly \"all you get for packin his stuff down to the landin to have it all ready for him and worryin yourself into shoe strings for fear he d miss the boat \" mac o flynn and potts condoled with the colonel while the fire of the old feud flamed and died yes the colonel admitted \"i d give five hundred dollars for a ticket on that steamer \" he looked in each of the three faces and knew the vague hope behind his words was vain but the boy had only laughed and caught up the baggage as the last whistle set the rampart echoes flying piping like a lot of frightened birds come along then look here the colonel burst out \"that s my stuff \" it s all the same you bring mine i ve got the tickets you and me and nig s goin to the klondyke chapter xx the klondyke poverty is an odious calling burton s anatomy of melancholy on monday morning the th of june they crossed the british line but it was not till wednesday the th at four in the afternoon just ten months after leaving san francisco that the oklahoma s passengers saw between the volcanic hills on the right bank of the yukon a stretch of boggy tundra whereon hundreds of tents gleamed pink and saffron just beyond the bold wooded height wearing the deep scar of a landslide on its breast just round that bend the klondyke river joins the yukon for this is dawson headquarters of the richest placer diggings the world has seen yet wearing more the air of a great army encampment for two miles the river bank shines with sunlit canvas tents tents everywhere as far as eye can see a mushroom growth masking the older cabins the water front swarms with craft scows and canoes birch canvas peterboro the great bateaux of the northern lumberman neat little skiffs clumsy rafts heavy \"double enders whip sawed from green timber with capacity of two to five tons lighters and barges carrying as much as forty tons all having come through the perils of the upper lakes and shot the canon rapids as the oklahoma steams nearer the town blossoms into flags a great murmur increases to a clamour people come swarming down to the water front waving union jacks and stars and stripes as well what does it all mean a cannon booms guns are fired and as the oklahoma swings into the bank a band begins to play a cheer goes up from fifteen thousand throats hurrah for the first steamer \" the oklahoma has opened the klondyke season of they got their effects off the boat and pitched the old tent up on the moosehide then followed days full to overflowing breathless fevered yet without result beyond a general stringing up of nerves the special spell of dawson was upon them all the surface aliveness the inner deadness the sense of being cut off from all the rest of the world as isolated as a man is in a dream with no past no future only a fantastic intensely vivid now this was the summer climate of the klondyke the colonel the boy and captain rainey maintained the illusion of prosecuting their affairs by frequenting the offices stores and particularly saloons where buyers and sellers most did congregate frequent mention was made of a certain valuable piece of property where was it down yonder at min ok and then nobody cared a straw it was true there was widespread dissatisfaction with the klondyke everyone agreed it had been overdone it would support one quarter of the people already here and tens of thousands on their way \"say klondyke and instantly your soberest man goes mad say anything else and he goes deaf \" min ok was a good camp but it had the disadvantage of lying outside the magic district the madness would of course not last but meanwhile the time went by and the people poured in day and night six great steamers full came up from the lower river and still the small craft kept on flocking like coveys of sea fowl through the upper lakes each party saying \"the crowd is behind \" on the th of june a toy whistle sounded shrill above the town and in puffed a liliputian \"steel hull\" steamer that had actually come \"on her own\" through the canon and shot the white horse rapids a steamer from the upper river after that others two were wrecked but who minded and still the people pouring in and still that cry \"the crowd s behind \" and still the clamour for quicker ampler means of transport to the north no matter what it cost the one consideration \"to get there and to get there quickly brought most of the horde by the canadian route yet as against the two ocean steamers all sufficient the year before to meet the five river boats at st michael s now by the all american route alone twenty ocean steamers and forty seven river boats double deckers some two hundred and twenty five feet long and every one crowded to the guards with people coming to the klondyke meanwhile many of those already there were wondering why they came and how they could get home in the tons of mail matter\" for dawson stranded at skaguay must be those \"instructions\" from the colonel s bank at home to the canadian bank of commerce dawson city he agreed with the boy that if very soon now they had not disposed of the min ok property they would go to the mines what s the good rasped mac \"every foot staked for seventy miles \" for my part admitted the boy \"i m less grand than i was i meant to make some poor devil dig out my min ok gold for me it ll be the other way about i ll dig gold for any man on bonanza that ll pay me wages \" they sat slapping at the mosquitoes till a whistle screamed on the lower river the boy called to nig and went down to the town to hear the news by and by mac came out with a pack and said he d be back in a day or two after he had disappeared among the tents a conquering army that had forced its way far up the hill by now the colonel got up and went to the spring for a drink he stood there a long time looking out wistfully not towards the common magnet across the klondyke but quite in the other direction towards the nearer gate of exit towards home what special brand of fool am i to be here down below nig with hot tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth now followed now led his master coming briskly up the slope that was the weare we heard whistlin said the boy breathless \"and who d you think s aboard \" who nicholas a pymeut pilot an he s got princess muckluck along no laughed the colonel following the boy to the tent \"what s the princess come for \" how should i know didn t she say didn t stop to hear reckon she was right glad to see you chaffed the colonel \"hey wasn t she \" i don t think she noticed i was there what you bolted no reply \"see here what you doin \" packin up where you goin been thinkin for some time i ain t wealthy enough to live in this metropolis there may be a place for a poor man but dawson isn t it well i didn t think you were that much of a coward turnin tail like this just because a poor little esquimaux besides she may have got over it even the higher races do and he went on poking his fun till suddenly the boy said you re in such high spirits i suppose you must have heard maudie s up from min ok you re jokin \" it ain t my idea of a joke she s comin up here soon s she s landed her stuff she s not comin up here why not anybody can come up on the moosehide and everybody s doin it i m goin to make way for some of em did she see you well she s seen potts anyhow you re right about dawson said the colonel suddenly \"it s too rich for my blood \" they pinned a piece of paper on the tent flap to say they were \"gone prospecting future movements uncertain \" each with a small pack and sticking out above it the klondyke shovel that had come all the way from san francisco nig behind with provisions in his little saddle bags and tongue farther out than ever they turned their backs on dawson crossed the lower corner of lot behind the government reserve stared with fresh surprise at the young market garden flourishing there down to the many islanded klondyke across in the scow ferry over the corduroy that cheers and deceives the new comer for that first mile of the bonanza trail on through pool and morass to the thicket of white birches where the colonel thought it well to rest awhile yes he felt the heat he said as he passed the time of day with other men going by with packs pack horses or draught dogs cursing at the trail and at the government that taxed the miners so cruelly and then did nothing for them not even making a decent highway to the dominion s source of revenue but out of the direct rays of the sun the traveller found refreshment and the mosquitoes were blown away by the keen breeze that seemed to come from off some glacier and the birds sang loud and the wild flowers starred the birch grove and the briar roses wove a tangle on either side the swampy trail on again dipping to a little valley bonanza creek they stood and looked well here we are yes this is what we came for and it was because of \"this\" that so vast a machinery of ships engines and complicated human lives had been set in motion what was it a dip in the hills where a little stream was caught up into sluices on either side of every line of boxes heaps and windrows of gravel above high on log cabin staging windlasses stretching away on either side gentle slopes mossed and flower starred here and there upon this ancient moose pasture tents and cabins set at random in the bed of the creek up and down in every direction squads of men sweating in the sun here where for untold centuries herds of leisurely and majestic moose had come to quench their thirst in the older cabins their horns still lorded it their bones were bleaching in the fire weed on from claim to claim the new comers to these rich pastures went till they came to the junction of the el dorado where huddles the haphazard settlement of the grand forks only twelve miles from dawson and now they were at the heart of \"the richest placer mining district the world has seen \" but they knew well enough that every inch was owned and that the best they could look for was work as unskilled labourers day shift or night on the claims of luckier men they had brought a letter from ryan of the north west mounted police to the superintendent of no above discovery a claim a little this side of the forks ryan had warned them to keep out of the way of the part owner scoville austin a surly person naturally so exasperated at the tax and so enraged at the rumour of government spies masquerading as workmen checking his reports that he was \"a first rate man to avoid \" but seymour the superintendent was in the words of the soothing motto of the whole american people \"all right \" they left their packs just inside the door of the log cabin indicated as \"bunk house for the men on no above\" a fearsome place where on shelf above shelf among long unwashed bedclothes the unwashed workmen of a prosperous company lay in the stupor of sore fatigue and semi asphyxiation someone stirred as the door opened and out of the fetid dusk of the unventilated closely shuttered cabin came a voice night shift on no then damn you shut the door as the never resting sun \"forced\" the dawson market garden and the wild roses of the trail so here on the creek men must follow the strenuous example no pause in the growing or the toiling of this northern world the day gang on no was hard at it down there where lengthwise in the channel was propped a line of sluice boxes steadied by regularly spaced poles laid from box to bank on gravel ridge looking down from above the whole was like a huge fish bone lying along the bed of the creek a little group of men with picks shovels and wheelbarrows were reducing the \"dump\" of winter pay piled beside a windlass conveying it to the sluices other men in line four or five feet below the level of the boxes were \"stripping picking and shovelling the gravel off the bed rock no easy business for even this summer temperature thawed but a few inches a day and below the frost of ten thousand years cemented the rubble into iron where is the superintendent \" that s seymour in the straw hat it was felt that even the broken and dilapidated article mentioned was a distinction and a luxury yes it was too hot up here in the klondyke they made their way to the man in authority a dark quiet mannered person with big gentle eyes not the sort of superintendent they had expected to find representing such a man as the owner of no having read ryan s letter and slowly scanned the applicants \"what do you know about it \" he nodded at the sluice all of nothing said the boy does it call for any particular knowing asked the colonel calls for muscle and plenty of keep at it his voice was soft but as the colonel looked at him he realized why a hard fellow like scoville austin had made this southerner superintendent better just try us i can use one more man on the night shift a dollar and a half an hour all right said the boy the colonel looked at him \"is this job yours or mine \" the superintendent had gone up towards the dam whichever you say the boy did not like to suggest that the colonel seemed little fit for this kind of exercise they had been in the klondyke long enough to know that to be in work was to be in luck i ll tell you the younger man said quickly answering something unspoken but plain in the colonel s face \"i ll go up the gulch and see what else there is \" it crossed his mind that there might be something less arduous than this shovelling in the wet thaw or picking at frozen gravel in the hot sun if so the colonel might be induced to exchange it was obvious that like so many southerners he stood the sun very ill while they were agreeing upon a rendezvous the superintendent came back our bunk house is yonder he said pointing a kind of sickness came over the kentuckian as he recalled the place he turned to his pardner wish we d got a pack mule and brought our tent out from dawson then apologetically to the superintendent \"you see sah there are men who take to bunk houses just as there are women who want to live in hotels and there are others who want a place to call home even if it s a tent \" the superintendent smiled \"that s the way we feel about it in alabama \" he reflected an instant \"there s that big new tent up there on the hill next to the buckeyes cabin good tent belongs to a couple o rich englishmen third owners in no gone to atlin told me to do what i liked with that tent you might bunk there while they re away \" now that s mighty good of you sah next whose cabin did you say oh i don t know their names they have a lay on seventeen ohio men they re called buck one and buck two anybody ll show you to the buckeyes and he turned away to shout \"gate \" for the head of water was too strong and he strode off towards the lock as the boy tramped about looking for work he met a great many on the same quest it seemed as if the colonel had secured the sole job on the creek still vacancies might occur any hour in the big new tent the colonel lay asleep on a little camp bed mercifully left there by the rich englishmen \"gettin ready for the night shift \" as he stood looking down upon him a sudden wave of pity came over the boy he knew the colonel didn t \"really and truly have to do this kind of thing he just didn t like givin in \" but behind all that there was a sense in the younger mind that here was a life unlike his own which dimly he foresaw was to find its legitimate expression in battle and in striving here in the person of the colonel no soldier fore ordained but a serene and equable soul wrenched out of its proper sphere by a chance hurt to a woman forsooth an imagination so stirred that if it slept at all it dreamed and moaned in its sleep as now a conscience wounded and refusing to heal had he not said himself that he had come up here to forget it was best to let him have the job that was too heavy for him yes it was best after all and so they lived for a few days the boy chafing and wanting to move on the colonel very earnest to have him stay something sure to turn up and anyhow letters my instruction and he encouraged the acquaintance the boy had struck up with the buckeyes hoping against hope that to go over and smoke a pipe and exchange experiences with such mighty good fellows would lighten the tedium of the long day spent looking for a job i call it a very pleasant cabin the colonel would say as he lit up and looked about anything dismaller it would be hard to find not clean and shipshape as the boy kept the tent but with double army blankets nailed over the single window it was blessedly dark if stuffy and in crying need of cleaning still they were mighty good fellows and they had a right to be cheerful up there on the rude shelf above the stove was a row of old tomato cans brimful of bonanza gold there they stood not even covered dim as the light was you could see the little top nuggets peering out at you over the ragged tin rims in a never locked shanty never molested never bothered about nearly every cabin on the creek had similar chimney ornaments but not everyone boasted an old coat kept under the bunk full of the bigger sort of nuggets the colonel was always ready with pretended admiration of such bric brac but the truth was he cared very little about this gold he had come so far to find his own wages paid in dust were kept in a jam pot the boy had found \"lyin round \" the growing store shone cheerfully through the glass but its value in the colonel s eyes seemed to be simply as an argument to prove that they had enough and \"needn t worry \" when the boy said there was no doubt this was the district in all the world the most overdone the colonel looked at him with sun tired reproachful eyes you want to dissolve the pardnership i see i don t but the colonel after any such interchange would go off and smoke by himself not even caring for buckeyes the work was plainly overtaxing him he slept badly was growing moody and quick to take offence one day when he had been distinctly uncivil he apologized for himself by saying that standing with feet always in the wet head always in the scorching sun he had taken a hell of a cold certain it was that without sullenness he would give in to long fits of silence and his wide honest eyes were heavy again as if the snow blindness of the winter had its analogue in a summer torment from the sun and his sometimes unusual gentleness to his companion was sharply alternated with unusual choler excited by a mere nothing enough if the boy were not in the tent when the colonel came and went of course the boy did the cooking the colonel ate almost nothing but he made a great point of his pardner s service in doing the cooking he would starve he said if he had to cook for himself as well as swing a shovel and the boy acting on pure instinct pretended that he believed this was so then came the evening when the boy was so late the colonel got his own breakfast and when the recreant did get home it was to announce that a man over at the buckeyes had just offered him a job out on indian river the colonel set down his tea cup and stared his face took on an odd rigid look but almost indifferently he said so you re goin of course you know i must i started with an outfit and fifteen hundred dollars now i haven t a cent the kentuckian raised his heavy eyes to the jam jar \"oh help yourself \" the boy laughed and shook his head i wish you wouldn t go the other said very low you see i ve got to why nig and i owe you for a week s grub already then the colonel stood up and swore swore till he was scarlet and shaking with excitement if the life up here has brought us to scowl austin s point of view we are poorly off and he spoke of the way men lived in his part of kentucky where the old fashion of keeping open house survived and didn t he know it was the same thing in florida \"wouldn t you do as much for me \" yes only i can t and i m restless the summer s half gone up here that means the whole year s half gone the colonel had stumbled back into his seat and now across the deal table he put out his hand don t go boy i don t know how i d get on without he stopped and his big hand was raised as if to brush away some cloud between him and his pardner \"if you go you won t come back \" oh yes i will you ll see i know the kind the other went on as if there had been no interruption \"they never come back i don t know as i ever cared quite as much for my brother little fella that died you know \" then seeing that his companion did not instantly iterate his determination to go that s right he said getting up suddenly and leaving his breakfast barely touched \"we ve been through such a lot together let s see it out \" without waiting for an answer he went off to his favourite seat under the little birch tree but the incident had left him nervous he would come up from his work almost on the run and if he failed to find his pardner in the tent there was the devil to pay the boy would laugh to himself to think what a lot he seemed able to stand from the colonel and then he would grow grave remembering what he had to make up for still his sense of obligation did not extend to giving up this splendid chance down on indian river on wednesday when the fellow over at the buckeyes was for going back the boy would go along on sunday morning he ran a crooked rusty nail into his foot clumsily extracted it left an ugly wound walking became a torture and the pain a banisher of sleep it was during the next few days that he found out how much the colonel lay awake who could sleep in this blazing sun black tents were not invented then so they lay awake and talked of many things the man from indian river went back alone the boy would limp after the colonel down to the sluice and sit on a dump heap with nig few people not there strictly on business were tolerated on no but nig and his master had been on good terms with seymour from the first now they struck up acquaintance with several of the night gang especially with the men who worked on either side of the colonel an irish gentleman who did the shovelling just below said he had graduated from dublin university he certainly had been educated somewhere and if the discussion were theologic would take out of his linen coat pocket a little testament in the vulgate to verify a bit of gospel he could even pelt the man next but one in his native tongue calling the silesian \"uebermensch \" there existed some doubt whether this were the gentleman s real name but none at all as to his talking philosophy with greater fervour than he bestowed on the puddling box the others were men more accustomed to work with their hands but in spite of the conscious superiority of your experienced miner a very good feeling prevailed in the gang a general friendliness that presently centred about the colonel for even in his present mood he was far from disagreeable except now and then to the man he cared the most for seymour admitted that he had placed the southerner where he thought he d feel most at home \"anyhow the company is less mixed he said than it was all winter up at twenty three where they had a presbyterian missionary down the shaft a salvation army captain turnin the windlass a nigger thief dumpin the becket and a dignitary of the church of england doin the cookin with the help of a chinese chore boy they re all there now except one washin out gold for the couple of san francisco card sharpers that own the claim \" vich von is gone asked the silesian who heard the end of the conversation oh the chinese chore boy is the one who s bettered himself said the superintendent \"makin more than all the others put together ever made in their lives runnin a laundry up at dawson \" the boy since this trouble with his foot had fallen into the way of turning night into day the colonel liked to have him down there at the sluice and when he thought about it the boy marvelled at the hours he spent looking on while others worked at first he said he came down only to make scowl austin mad and it did make him mad at first but the odd thing was he got over it and used to stop and say something now and then this attention on the part of the owner was distinctly perilous to the boy s good standing with the gang not because austin was the owner there was the millionaire swede ole olsen any man might talk to him he was on the square treated his workmen mighty fair and when the other owners tried to reduce wages and did ole wouldn t join them went right along paying the highest rate on the creek various stories were afloat about austin oh yes scowl austin was a hard man the only owner on the creek who wouldn t even pay the little subscription every poor miner contributed to keep the dawson catholic hospital going the women too had grievances against austin not only \"the usual lot\" up at the gold belt who sneered at his close fist but some of the other sort those few hard working wives or \"women on their own or those who washed and cooked for this claim or that they had stories about austin that shed a lurid light and so by degrees the gathered experience good and ill of the greatest of all placer diggin s\" flowed by the idler on the bank you seem to have a lot to do seymour would now and then say with a laugh so i have what do you call it takin stock of us of things in general what did you mean by that demanded the colonel suspiciously when the superintendent had passed up the line the shovelling in was done for the time being the water was to be regulated and then the clean up as soon as the owner came down better not let austin hear you say you re takin stock he ll run you out o the creek the boy only smiled and went on fillipping little stones at nig what did you mean the colonel persisted with a look as suspicious as scowl austin s own oh nothin i m only thinkin out things your future i suppose he said testily mine and other men s the klondyke s a great place to get things clear in your head don t find it so the colonel put up his hand with that now familiar action as if to clear away a cloud \"it s days since i had anything clear in my head except the lesson we learned on the trail \" the boy stopped throwing stones and fixed his eyes on his friend as the colonel went on we had that hammered into us didn t we what oh that you know that i don t know quite how to put it so it ll sound as orthodox as it might be bein true but it looks pretty clear even to me again the big hand brushing at the unmoted sunshine \"that the only reason men got over bein beasts was because they began to be brothers \" don t said the boy don t what i ve always known i should have to tell you some time i won t be able to put it off if i stay and i hate tellin you now see here i b lieve i ll get a pack mule and go over to indian river the colonel looked round angrily standing high against the sky seymour with the gateman up at the lock was moderating the strong head of water it began to flow sluggishly over the gravel clogged riffles and scowl austin was coming down the hill i don t know what you re drivin at about somethin to tell i know one thing though and i learned it up here in the north men were meant to stick to one another don t i say here s austin whispered the colonel the silesian philosopher stood in his \"gum boots\" in the puddling box as on a rostrum but silent now as ever when scowl austin was in sight with the great sluice fork the philosopher took up washed and threw out the few remaining big stones that they might not clog the narrow boxes below seymour had so regulated the stream that in place of the gush and foam of a few minutes before there was now only a scant and gently falling veil of water playing over the bright gravel caught in the riffle lined bottoms of the boxes as the boy got up and reached for his stick austin stood there saying to nobody in particular that he d just been over to no where they were trying a new fangled riffle don t your riffles do the trick all right asked the boy if you re in any doubt come and see he said they stood together leaning over the sluice looking in at one of the things human industry has failed to disfigure nearly as beautiful to day as long ago on pactolus banks when lydian shepherds with great stones fastened fleeces in the river that they might catch and gather for king croesus the golden sands of tmolus improving not in beauty but economy quite in the modern spirit the greeks themselves discovered that they lost less gold if they led the stream through fleece lined water troughs and beyond this device of those early placer miners we have not progressed so far but that in every long narrow sluice box in the world to day you may see a lydian water trough with a riffle in the bottom for a golden fleece the rich klondyker and the poor one stood together looking in at the water still low still slipping softly over polished pebbles catching at the sunlight winking dimpling glorifying flint and jasper agate and obsidian dazzling the uncommercial eye to blind forgetfulness of the magic substance underneath austin gathered up one by one a handful of the shining stones and tossed them out then bending down \"see \" there under where the stones had been neatly caught in the lattice of the riffle lying thick and packed by the water action a heavy ridge of black and yellow magnetic sand and gold riffles out called seymour and the men who had been extracting the rusty nails that held them firm lifted out from the bottom of each box a wooden lattice soused it gently in the water and laid it on the bank the boy had turned away again but stood an instant noticing how the sun caught at the countless particles of gold still clinging to the wood for this was one of the old riffles frayed by the action of much water and the fret of many stones soon it would have to be burned and out of its ashes the careful austin would gather up with mercury all those million points of light meanwhile seymour had called to the gateman for more water and himself joining the gang armed now with flat metal scoops they all began to turn over and throw back against the stream the debris in the bottom of the boxes giving the water another chance to wash out the lighter stuff and clean the gold from all impurity away went the last of the sand and away went the pebbles dark or bright away went much of the heavy magnetic iron scowl austin at the end of the line had a corn whisk with which he swept the floor of the box always upstream gathering the contents in a heap now on this side now on that letting the water play and sort and carry away condensing hastening the process that for ages had been concentrating gold in the arctic placers say look here shouted austin to the boy already limping up the hill when he had reached the sluice again he found that all scowl austin wanted apparently was to show him how when he held the water back with the whisk it eddied softly at each side of the broad little broom leaving exposed the swept up pile see what s all that what do you think looks like a heap o sawdust austin actually laughed see if it feels like sawdust take it up like this he ordered his visitor obeyed lifting a double handful out of the water and holding it over the box dripping gleaming the most beautiful thing that comes out of the earth save only life and the assertion may stand even if the distinction is without difference if the crystal is born grows old and dies as undeniably as the rose the boy held the double handful of well washed gold up to the sunshine feeling to the full the immemorial spell cast by the king of metals nothing that men had ever made out of gold was so entirely beautiful as this scowl austin s grim gratification was openly heightened with the rich man s sense of superiority but his visitor seemed to have forgotten him colonel here a minute we thought it looked wonderful enough on the big chimney table but lord to see it like this out o doors mixed with sunshine and water still he stood there fascinated leaning heavily against the sluice box still with his dripping hands full when after a hurried glance the colonel returned to his own box none of the gang ever talked in the presence of the owner guess that looks good to you austin slightly stressed the pronoun he had taken a reasonless liking for the young man who from the first had smiled into his frowning face and treated him as he treated others or perhaps austin liked him because although the boy did a good deal of \"gassin with the gang he had never hung about at clean ups at all events he should stay to night partly because when the blue devils were down on scowl austin nothing cheered him like showing his luck\" off to someone and it was so seldom safe in these days people talked the authorities conceived unjust suspicions of a man s returns and then far back in his head that vague need men feel when a good thing has lost its early zest to see its dimmed value shine again in an envious eye here was a young fellow who before he went lame had been all up and down the creek for days looking for a job probably hadn t a penny livin off his friend who himself would starve but for the privilege austin gave him of washing out austin s gold let the young man stop and see the richest clean up at the forks and so it was with the acrid pleasure he had promised himself that he said to the visitor bending over the double handful of gold \"guess it looks good to you \" yes it looks good but he had lifted his eyes and seemed to be studying the man more than the metal a couple of newcomers going by halted christ said the younger \"look at that \" the boy remembered them they had been to seymour only a couple of hours before asking for work one was old for that country nearly sixty and looked as one of the gang had said \"as if instid o findin the pot o gold he had got the end of the rainbow slam in his face kind o blinded \" at sound of the strange voice austin had wheeled about with a fierce look and heavily the strangers plodded by the owner turned again to the gold \"yes he said curtly there s something about that that looks good to most men \" what i was thinkin replied the boy slowly \"was that it was the only clean gold i d ever seen but it isn t so clean as it was \" what do you mean austin bent and looked sharply into the full hands i was thinkin it was good to look at because it hadn t got into dirty pockets yet austin stared at him an instant \"never been passed round never bought anybody no one had ever envied it or refused it to help someone out of a hole that was why i thought it looked good because it was clean gold a little while ago \" and he plunged his hands in the water and washed the clinging particles off his fingers austin had stared and then turned his back with a blacker look than even \"scowl\" had ever worn before gosh guess there s goin to be trouble said one of the gang chapter xxi pardners he saw and first of brotherhood had sight it was morning and the night shift might go to bed but in the absent englishmen s tent there was little sleep and less talk that day the boy in an agony with a foot on fire heard the colonel turning tossing growling incoherently about \"the light \" it seemed unreasonable for a frame had been built round his bed and on it thick gray army blankets were nailed a rectangular tent had he cursed the heat now but no \"light god the light the light \" just as if he were lying as the boy was in the strong white glare of the tent but hour after hour within the stifling fortress the giant tossed and muttered at the swords of sunshine that pierced his semi dusk through little spark burnt hole or nail tear torturing sensitive eyes near three hours before he needed the colonel got up and splashed his way through a toilet at the tin basin the boy made breakfast without waiting for the usual hour they had nearly finished when it occurred to the colonel that neither had spoken since they went to bed he glanced across at the absorbed face of his friend you ll come down to the sluice to night won t you why shouldn t i no reason on earth only i was afraid you were broodin over what you said to austin austin oh i m not thinkin about austin what then what makes you so quiet well i m thinkin i d be better satisfied to stay here a little longer if if what if there was truth between us two i thought there was no what s the reason you want me to stay here reason why he laughed in his old way \"i don t defend my taste but i kind o like to have you round \" his companion s grave face showed no lightening \"why do you want me round more than someone else \" haven t got anyone else oh yes you have every man on bonanza s a friend o yours or would be it isn t just that we understand each other no we don t what s wrong no answer the boy looked through the door across bonanza to the hills i thought we understood each other if two men ever did haven t we travelled the long trail together and seen the ice go out that s just it colonel we know such a lot more than men do who haven t travelled the trail and some of the knowledge isn t oversweet a shadow crossed the kind face opposite you re thinkin about the times i pegged out didn t do my share lord no the tears sprang up in the young eyes \"i m thinkin o the times i \" he laid his head down on the rude table and sat so for an instant with hidden face then he straightened up \"seems as if it s only lately there s been time to think it out and before as long as i could work i could get on with myself seemed as if i stood a chance to a little to make up \" make up but it s always just as it was that day on the oklahoma when the captain swore he wouldn t take on another pound i was awfully happy thinkin if i made him bring you it might kind o make up but it didn t made a big difference to me the colonel said still not able to see the drift but patiently brushing now and then at the dazzling mist and waiting for enlightenment it s always the same the other went on \"whenever i ve come up against something i d hoped was goin to make up it s turned out to be a thing i d have to do anyway and there was no make up about it for all that i shouldn t mind stayin on awhile since you want me to \" the colonel interrupted him \"that s right \" only if i do you ve got to know what i d never have guessed myself but for the trail after i ve told you if you can bear to see me round he hesitated and suddenly stood up his eyes still wet but his head so high an onlooker who did not understand english would have called the governing impulse pride defiance even \"it seems i m the kind of man colonel the kind of man who could leave his pardner to die like a dog in the snow \" if any other fella said so i d knock him down that night before we got to snow camp when you wouldn t couldn t go any farther i meant to go and leave you take the sled and take i guess i meant to take everything and leave you to starve they looked into each other s faces and years seemed to go by the colonel was the first to drop his eyes but the other pitilessly like a judge arraigning a felon his steady scrutiny never flinching \"do you want that kind of a man round colonel \" the kentuckian turned quickly as if to avoid the stab of the other s eye and sat hunched together elbows on knees head in hands i knew you didn t the boy answered his own question he limped over to his side of the tent picked up some clothes his blanket and few belongings and made a pack not a word not a sound but some birds twittering outside in the sun and a locust making that frying sound in the fire weed the pack was slung on the boy s back and he was throwing the diamond hitch to fasten it when the colonel at last looked round lord what you doin guess i m goin on where i ll write you when i know maybe i ll even send you what i owe you but i don t feel like boastin at the moment nig you can t walk did you never happen to notice that one legged fella pluggin about dawson he had gone down on his hands and knees to see if nig was asleep under the camp bed the colonel got up went to the door and let down the flap when he turned the traveller and the dog were at his elbow he squared his big frame at the entrance looking down at the two tried to speak but the boy broke in \"don t let s get sentimental colonel just stand aside \" never stirring he found a voice to say \"i m not askin you to stay\" the other turned and whistled for nig had retired again to the seclusion of the gray blanket screen \"i only want to tell you something before you go \" the boy frowned a little but rested his pack against the table in that way in which the klondyker learns to make a chair back of his burden you seem to think you ve been tellin me news said the colonel when you said that about goin on the night before we got to snow camp i knew you simply meant you still intended to come out alive i had thrown up my hands at least i thought i had the only difference between us i had given in and you hadn t the other shook his head \"there was a lot more in it than that \" you meant to take the only means there were to carry off the sled that i couldn t pull any farther the boy looked up quickly something stern and truth compelling in the dark face forced the colonel to add \"and along with the sled you meant to carry off the the things that meant life to us \" just that the boy knotted his brown fingers in nig s hair as if to keep tight hold of one friend in the wreck we couldn t divide the colonel hurried on \"it was a case of crawlin on together and maybe come out alive or part and one die sure \" the boy nodded tightening his lips i knew well enough you d fight for the off chance but the colonel came away from the door and stood in front of his companion \"so would i i hadn t really given up the struggle \" you were past strugglin and i would have left you sick you wouldn t have left me if i d had my gun the boy remembered that he had more than suspected that at the time but the impression had by and by waxed dim it was too utterly unlike the colonel a thing dreamed he had grown as ashamed of the dream as of the thing he knew was true the egotism of memory absorbed itself in the part he himself had played that other an evil fancy born of an evil time and here was the colonel saying it was true the boy dropped his eyes it had all happened in the night there was something in the naked truth too ghastly for the day but the colonel went on in a harsh whisper i looked round for my gun if i d found it i d have left you behind and the boy kept looking down at nig and the birds sang and the locust whirred and the hot sun filled the tent as high tide flushes a sea cave you ve been a little hard on me boy bringin it up like this remindin me i wouldn t have gone on myself and makin me admit no no colonel makin me admit that before i would have let you go on i d have shot you colonel he loosed his hold of nig i rather reckon i owe you my life and something else besides the colonel laid one hand on the thin shoulder where the pack strap pressed and closed the other hand tight over his pardner s right \"and i hadn t meant even to thank you neither \" don t for the lord s sake don t said the younger and neither dared look at the other a scratching on the canvas the northern knock at the door you fellers sound awake a woman s voice under his breath \"who the devil s that \" inquired the colonel brushing his hand over his eyes before he got across the tent maudie had pushed the flap aside and put in her head hello hell o how d e do he shook hands and the younger man nodded \"hello \" when did you come to town asked the colonel mendaciously why nearly three weeks ago on the weare heard you had skipped out to sulphur with maccann i had some business out that way so that s where i been have some breakfast won t you dinner i mean i put that job through at the road house got to rustle around now and get my tent up where s a good place well i i hardly know goin to stay some time depends the boy slipped off his pack they ve got rooms at the gold belt he said you mean that dance hall up at the forks oh it ain t so far i remember you can walk i can do one or two other things take care you don t hurt yourself worryin about me hurt myself yes bein so hospittable the way you re pressin me to settle right down here near s possible why it s real touchin he laughed and went to the entrance to tic back the door flap which was whipping and snapping in the breeze heaven be praised the night was cooler nig had been perplexed when he saw the pack pushed under the table he followed his master to the door and stood looking at the flap tying ears very pointed critical eye cocked asking as plain as could be \"you wake me up and drag me out here into the heat and mosquitoes just to watch you doin that well i ve my opinion of you \" colonel gone down inquired the silesian passing by not yet anything i can do the gentleman inside was saying with a sound of effort in his voice the lady was not even at the pains to notice the perfunctory civility well colonel now you re here what do you think o the klondyke think well there s no doubt they ve taken a lot o gold out o here reg lar old has been hey oh i don t say it hasn t got a future what don t you know the boom s busted well no has tax begun it too many cheechalkos are finishing it klondyke she laughed \"the klondyke s goin to hell down grade in a hand car \" scowl austin was up ready as usual to relieve seymour of half the superintending but never letting him off duty till he had seen the new shift at work as the boy limped by with the german austin turned his scowl significantly towards the colonel s tent good mornin good night i mean laughed the lame man just as if his tongue had not run away with him the last time the two had met it was not often that anyone spoke so pleasantly to the owner of no perhaps the circumstance weighed with him at all events he stopped short when the german had gone on \"foot s better austin asserted perhaps it is a little though the lame man had no reason to think so lucky you heal quick most people don t up here livin on the stale stuff we get in this country seymour said anything to you about a job \" no well since you re on time you better come on the night shift instead o that lazy friend o yours oh he ain t lazy been up hours an old acquaintance dropped in he ll be down in a minute tisn t only his bein late you better come on the shift don t think i could do that what s the matter don t say there s anything very much the matter yet but he s sick ain t he sick no except as we all are sick o the eternal glare the colonel was coming slowly down the hill of course a man doesn t look his best if he hasn t slept the boy limped a little way back to meet him anything the matter with you colonel well my bonanza headache ain t improved i suppose you wouldn like me to take over the job for two or three days you crippled look here the colonel flushed suddenly \"austin been sayin anything \" oh i was just thinkin about the sun well when i want to go in out of the sun i ll say so and walking more quickly than he had done for long he left his companion marched down to the creek and took his place near the puddling box by the time the boy got to the little patch of shade offered by the staging austin had turned his back on the gang and was going to speak to the gateman at the locks he had evidently left the colonel very much enraged at some curt comment he meant it for us all the dublin gentleman was saying soothingly by and by as they worked undisturbed serenity returned oh the colonel was all right even more chipper than usual what a good looking fella he was with that clear skin and splendid colour a couple of hours later the colonel set his long shovel against the nearest of the poles steadying the sluice and went over to the staging for a drink he lifted the can of weak tea to his lips and took a long draught handed the can back to the boy and leant against the staging they talked a minute or two in undertones a curt voice behind said \"looks like you ve got a deal to attend to to day beside your work \" they looked round and there was austin as the colonel saw who it was had spoken the clear colour in the tan deepened he threw back his shoulders hesitated and then without a word went and took up his shovel austin walked on the boy kept looking at his friend what was the matter with the colonel it was not only that his eyes were queer most of the men complained of their eyes unless they slept in cabins but whether through sun blindness or shaken by anger the colonel was handling his shovel uncertainly fumbling at the gravel content with half a shovelful and sometimes gauging the distance to the box so badly that some of the pay fell down again in the creek as austin came back on the other side of the line he stopped opposite to where the colonel worked and suddenly called \"seymour \" like so many on bonanza the superintendent could not always sleep when the time came he was walking about \"showing things\" to a stranger \"a newspaper woman it was whispered at all events a lady who armed with letters from the highest british officials had come to write up the klondyke \" seymour had left her at his employer s call the lady thin neat alert with crisply curling iron gray hair and pleasant but unmistakably dignified expression stood waiting for him a moment on the heap of tailings then innocently followed her guide although austin lowered his voice she drew nearer prepared to take an intelligent interest in the \"new riffles up on skookum \" when austin had first called seymour the colonel started looked up and watched the little scene with suspicion and growing anger seeing seymour s eyes turn his way the kentuckian stopped shovelling and on a sudden impulse called out see here austin if you ve any complaints to make sah you d better make them to my face sah the conversation about riffles thus further interrupted a little silence fell the superintendent stood in evident fear of his employer but he hastened to speak conciliatory words no complaint at all one of the best hands may be so when he ain t sick said austin contemptuously sick the boy called out \"why you re dreamin he s our strong man able to knock spots out of anyone on the creek ain t he \" appealing to the gang i shall be able to spare him from my part of the creek after to night do i understand you are dismissing me oh go to hell the colonel dropped his shovel and clenched his hands get the woman out o the way said the owner \"there s goin to be trouble with this fire eating southerner \" the woman turned quickly the colonel diving under the sluice box for a plunge at austin came up face to face with her the lady said the colonel catching his breath shaking with rage but pulling off his hat \"the lady is quite safe but i m not so sure about you \" he swerved as if to get by safe i should think so she said steadily comprehending all at once and not unwilling to create a diversion this is no place for a woman not if she s got twenty letters from the gold commissioner misunderstanding austin s jibe at the official the lady stood her ground smiling into the face of the excited kentuckian several people have asked me if i was not afraid to be alone here and i ve said no it s quite true i ve travelled so much that i came to know years ago it s not among men like you a woman has anything to fear it was funny and pathetic to see the infuriate colonel clutching at his grand manner bowing one instant to the lady shooting death and damnation the next out of heavy eyes at austin but the wiry little woman had the floor and meant for peace sake to keep it a few moments at home in the streets of london i have been rudely spoken to i have been greatly annoyed in paris in new york i have been subject to humorous impertinence but in the great north west every man has seemed to be my friend in fact wherever our english tongue is spoken she wound up calmly putting the great austin in his place \"a woman may go alone \" austin seemed absorbed in filling his pipe the lady tripped on to the next claim with a sedate \"good night\" to the men on no she thought the momentary trouble past and never turned to see how the kentuckian waiting till she should be out of earshot came round in front of austin with a low question the gang watched the boy dodge under the sluice and hobble hurriedly over the chaos of stones towards the owner before he reached him he called breathless but trying to laugh you think the colonel s played out but take my word for it he ain t a man to fool with the gang knew from austin s sneering look as he turned to strike a match on a boulder they knew as well as if they d been within a yard of him that scowl had said something \"pretty mean \" they saw the colonel make a plunge and they saw him reel and fall among the stones the owner stood there smoking while the night gang knocked off work under his nose and helped the boy to get the colonel on his feet it was no use either he had struck his head or he was dazed unable at all events to stand they lifted him up and started for the big tent three indians accosted the cripple leading the procession he started and raised his eyes \"nicholas muckluck \" they shook hands and all went on together the boy saying the colonel had a little sunstroke the next day scowl austin was found lying face down among the cotton woods above the benches on skookum a bullet wound in his back he had fainted from loss of blood when he was picked up by the two vermonters the men who had twice gone by no the night before the quarrel and who had enraged austin by stopping an instant during the clean up to look at his gold they carried him back to bonanza the superintendent and several of the day gang got the wounded man into bed he revived sufficiently to say he had not seen the man that shot him but he guessed he knew him all the same then he turned on his side swore feebly at the lawlessness of the south and gave up the ghost not a man on the creek but understood who scowl austin meant them hot headed kentuckians y know they d dowse a feller s glim for less n that little doubt the colonel done it all right why his own pardner says to austin s face says he the colonel s a bad man to fool with and just then the big chap plunged at austin like a mad bull but they were sorry to a man and said among themselves that they d see he was defended proper even if he hadn t nothin but a little dust in a jam pot the grand forks constable had put a watch on the big tent despatched a man to inform the dawson chief of police and set himself to learn the details of the quarrel meanwhile the utter absence of life in the guarded tent roused suspicion it was recalled now that since the indians had left a little while after the colonel was carried home sixteen hours ago no one had seen either of the southerners the constable taking alarm at this left the crowd at scowl austin s and went hurriedly across the meadow to the new centre of interest just as he reached the tent the flap was turned back and maudie put her head out hah said the constable with some relief \"they both in there \" the colonel is now it was the colonel he had wanted till he heard he was there as the woman came out he looked in to make certain yes there he was calmly sleeping with the gray blanket of the screen thrown up for air it didn t look much like where s the other feller gone to dawson with that lame leg went on horseback it had as grand a sound as it would have in the states to say a man had departed in a glass coach drawn by six cream coloured horses but he had been \"in a hell of a hurry evidently men were exchanging glances funny nobody saw him \" when d he light out about five this morning oh that explained it the people who were up at five were abed now and the group round the tent whispered that austin had done the unheard of had gone off and left the night gang at three o clock in the morning they had said so as the day shift turned out but how d the young feller get such a thing as a horse hired it off a stranger out from dawson yesterday maudie answered shortly oh that frenchman count a whirligig but maudie was tired of giving information and getting none the answer came from one in the group yes that french feller came in with a couple o fusst class horses he s camped away over there beyond muskeeter he pointed down bonanza p raps you won t mind just mentionin said maudie with growing irritation \"why you re makin yourself so busy about my friends \" only strong resentment could have induced the plural when she heard what had happened and what was suspected she uttered a contemptuous \"tschah \" and made for the tent the constable followed she wheeled fiercely round the man in there hasn t been out o this tent since he was carried up from the creek last night i can swear to it can you swear the other was here all the time no answer did he say what he went to dawson for the doctor one or two laughed \"who s sick enough to send for a dawson doctor \" so you think he s gone for a i know he is and do you know what it costs to have a doctor come all the way out here yes beasts won t budge till you ve handed over five hundred dollars skunks did your friend mention how he meant to raise the dust he s got it she said curtly why he was livin off his pardner hadn t a red cent she s shieldin him the men about the door agreed lord he done it well got away with five hundred and a horse he had words with austin himself the night o the clean up sassed scowl austin right quiet but oh my told him to his face his gold was dirty and washed it off his hands with a look gawd you could see austin was mad clear through from his shirt buttons to his spine you bet scowl said something back that got the young feller s monkey up they all agreed that the only wonder was that austin had lived as long \"on the other side o the line gee \" that evening the boy riding hard came into camp with a doctor followed discreetly in the rear by an n w m p really mounted this time it had occurred to the boy that people looked at him hard and when he saw the groups gathered about the tent his heart contracted sharply had the colonel died he flung himself off the horse winced as his foot cried out told joey bludsoe to look after both beasts a minute and led the dawson doctor towards the tent the constable followed maudie at the door looked at her old enemy queerly and just as without greeting he pushed by \"s pose you ve heard scowl austin s dead \" she said in a low voice no dead eh well there s one rattlesnake less in the woods the constable stopped him with a touch on the shoulder \"we have a warrant for you \" the colonel lifted his head and stared about in a dazed way as the boy stopped short and stammered \"warr what for \" for the murder of scoville look here he whispered \"i i don t know what you mean but i ll go along with you of course only don t talk before this man he s sick \" he beckoned the doctor \"this is the man i brought you to see \" then he turned his back on the wide horrified eyes of his friend saying \"back in a minute kentucky \" outside \"give me a second boys will you \" he said to the n w m p s \"just till i hear what that doctor fella says about my pardner \" he stood there with the buckeyes the police and the various day gangs that were too excited to go to bed and he asked them where austin was found and other details of the murder wearily conscious that the friendliest there felt sure that the man who questioned could best fill in the gaps in the story when the doctor came out maudie at his heels firing off quick questions the boy hobbled forward well temperature a hundred and four said the dawson doctor oh is is that much or little well it s more than most of us go in for can you tell what s the matter with him oh typhoid of course the boy pulled his hat over his eyes guess you won t mind my stayin now said maudie at his elbow speaking low he looked up \"you goin to take care of him good care \" he asked harshly but maudie seemed not to mind the tears went down her cheeks as with never a word she nodded and turned towards the tent say he hobbled after her \"that doctor s all right only wanted fifty \" he laid four hundred dollar bills in her hand she seemed about to speak when he interrupted hoarsely \"and look here pull the colonel through maudie pull him through \" i ll do my darnedest he held out his hand he had never given it to her before and he forgot that few people would care now to take it but she gave him hers with no grudging then on a sudden impulse \"you ain t takin him to dawson to night \" she said to the constable he nodded why he s done the trip twice already i can do it again well enough then you got to wait a minute she spoke to the constable as if she had been captain constantine himself \"better just go in and see the colonel she said to the boy he s been askin for you \" n no maudie i can go to dawson all right but i don t feel up to goin in there again you ll be sorry if you don t and then he knew what a temperature at a hundred and four foreboded he went back into the tent dreading to face the colonel more than he had ever dreaded anything in his life but the sick man lay looking out drowsily peacefully through half shut eyes not greatly concerned one would say about anything the boy went over and stood under the gray blanket canopy looking down with a choking sensation that delayed his question \"how you feelin now kentucky \" all right why that s good news then you you won t mind my goin off to to do a little prospectin the sick man frowned \"you stay right where you are there s plenty in that jampot \" yes yes jampot s fillin up fine besides the low voice wavered on \"didn t we agree we d learned the lesson o the north \" the lesson o the north repeated the other with filling eyes yes sah a man alone s a man lost we got to stick together boy the eyelids fell heavily yes yes colonel he pressed the big hand his mouth made the motion not the sound \"good bye pardner \" chapter xxii the going home \"despair lies down and grovels grapples not with evil casts the burden of its lot this age climbs earth to challenge heaven not less the lower deeps it laughs at happiness \" george meredith everybody on bonanza knew that the colonel had left off struggling to get out of his bed to go to work had left off calling for his pardner quite in his right senses again he could take in maudie s explanation that the boy was gone to dawson probably to get something for the colonel to eat for the doctor was a crank and wouldn t let the sick man have his beans and bacon forbade him even such a delicacy as fresh pork though the buckeyes nobly offered to slaughter one of their newly acquired pigs the first that ever rooted in bonanza refuse and more a terror to the passing indian than any bear or wolf but the boy s a long time the colonel would say wistfully before this quieter phase set in maudie had sent into dawson for potts o flynn and mac that they might distract the colonel s mind from the pardner she knew could not return but o flynn having married the girl at the moosehorn caf had excuse of ancient validity for not coming potts was busy breaking the faro bank and mac was waiting till an overdue lower river steamer should arrive nicholas of pymeut had gone back as pilot of the weare but princess muckluck was still about now with skookum bill son of the local chief now alone trudging up and down bonanza like one looking for something lost the colonel heard her voice outside the tent and had her in you goin to marry skookum bill as they say muckluck only laughed but the indian hung about waiting the princess s pleasure when your pardner come back she would indiscreetly ask the colonel why he goes to dawson and every few hours she would return \"why he stay so long \" at last maudie took her outside and told her muckluck gaped sat down a minute and rocked her body back and forth with hidden face got up and called sharply \"skookum \" they took the trail for town potts said when he passed them they were going as if the devil were at their heels wouldn t even stop to say how the colonel was so potts had come to see for himself and to bring the colonel some letters just arrived mac was close behind but the boy no no they wouldn t let anybody see him and potts shook his head well you can come in said maudie \"if you keep your head shut about the boy \" the colonel was lying flat with that unfaltering ceiling gaze of the sick now his vision dropped to the level of faces at the door hello but as they advanced he looked behind them anxiously only mac no kaviak at his heels and the sick man s disappointment lightened to a smile he would have held out a hand but maudie stopped him she took the little fellow s fingers and laid them on the colonel s now sit down and be quiet she said nervously potts and mac obeyed but kaviak had fastened his fine little hand on the weak one and anchored so stared about taking his bearings how did you get to the klondyke kaviak said the colonel in a thin breathy voice came up with sister winifred farva answered for him \"she was sent for to help with the epidemic dyin like flies in dawson h m ahem \" apologetic glance at maudie \"sister winifred promised to keep kaviak with her woman of her word \" well what you think o dawson the low voice asked kaviak understood the look at least and smiled back grew suddenly grave intent looked sharply round loosed his hold of the colonel bent down and retired behind the bed that was where nig was their foregathering added nothing to the tranquility of the occasion and both were driven forth by maudie potts read the colonel his letters and helped him to sign a couple of cheques the \"louisville instructions\" had come through at last after that the colonel slept and when he woke it was only to wander away into that world where maudie was lost utterly and where the colonel was at home there was chastening in such hours for maudie of min ok \"now he s found the other one she would say to herself the one he was looking for \" that same evening as they sat in the tent in an interval of relief from the colonel s muttering monotone they heard nig making some sort of unusual manifestation outside heard the grunting of those pioneer pigs heard sounds of a whispered \"sh kaviak shut up nig \" then a low tuneless crooning \"wen yo see a pig a goin along widder straw in de sider is mouf it ll be er tuhble wintuh en yo bettah move down souf \" why the boy s back said the colonel suddenly in a clear collected voice maudie had jumped up but the boy put his head in the tent smiling and calling out they told me he was getting on all right but i just thought maybe he was asleep he came in and bent over his pardner \"hello everybody why you got it so fine and dark in here i can hardly see how well you re lookin colonel \" and he dropped into the nurse s place by the bedside maudie s lined the tent with black drill said the colonel \"you brought home anything to eat \" well no maudie telegraphed \"found it all i could do to bring myself back \" oh well that s the main thing said the colonel battling with disappointment pricked by some quickened memory of the boy s last home coming \"i ve had pretty queer dreams about you been givin maudie the meanest kind of a time \" don t go gassin colonel admonished the nurse it s pretty tough i can tell you he said irritably \"to be as weak as a day old baby and to have to let other people \" mustn t talk ordered mac the colonel raised his head with sudden anger it did not mend matters that maudie was there to hold him down before a lot of men you go to halifax said the boy to mac blustering a trifle \"the colonel may stand a little orderin about from maudie don t blame him m self but kentucky ain t going to be bossed by any of us \" the colonel lay quite still again and when he spoke it was quietly enough reckon i m in the kind of a fix when a man s got to take orders foolishness don t let him jolly you boys the colonel s always sayin he ain t a soldier but i reckon you better look out how you rile kentucky the sick man ignored the trifling \"the worst of it is bein so useless \" useless you just wait till you see what a lot o use we mean to make of you no crawlin out of it like that it s quite true said mac harshly \"we all kind of look to you still \" course we do the boy turned to the others \"the o flynns comin all the way out from dawson to morrow to get kentucky s opinion on a big scheme o theirs did you ever hear what that long headed lincoln said when the civil war broke out i would like to have god on my side but i must have kentucky \" i ve been so out o my head i thought you were arrested no out of your head about it was arrested they thought i d cleared scowl austin off the earth do they know who did potts and maudie asked in a breath that klondyke indian that s sweet on princess muckluck what had austin done to him nothin reckon skookum bill was about the only man on bonanza who had no objection to the owner of o said so in court what did he kill him for well said the boy \"it s just one o those topsy turvy things that happen up here you saw that indian that came in with nicholas some years ago he killed a drunken white man who was after him with a knife there was no means of tryin the indian where the thing happened so he was taken outside the court found he d done the killin in self defence and sent him back well sir that native had the time of his life bein tried for murder he d travelled on a railroad seen a white man s city lived like a lord and came home to be the most famous man of his tribe got a taste for travel too comes to the klondyke and his fame fires skookum bill all you got to do is to kill one o these white men and they take you and show you all the wonders o the earth so he puts a bullet into austin why didn t he own up then and get his reward muckluck knew better made him hold his tongue about it and then made him own up when she saw the boy nodded what s goin to happen oh he ll swing to morrow instead o me by the way colonel a fella hunted me up this mornin who d been to min ok looked good to him i ve sold out idaho bar nough to buy back your orange grove he shook his head \" nough to pay my debts and start over again \" when the dawson doctor left that night maudie as usual followed him out they waited a long time for her to come back perhaps she s gone to her own tent and the boy went to see he found her where the colonel used to go to smoke sitting staring out to nowhere as the boy looked closer he saw she had been crying for even in the midst of honest service maudie like many a fine lady before her could not forego the use of cosmetic her cheeks were streaked and stained five dollars a box here too she said mechanically as she wiped some of the rouge off with a handkerchief her hand shook what s the matter it s all up she answered not with him he motioned towards the tent she nodded doctor says so and i knew it before only i wouldn t believe it she had spoken with little agitation but now she flung her arms out with a sudden anguish that oddly took the air of tossing into space bonanza and its treasure it was the motion of one who renounces the thing that means the most a final fling in the face of the gods the boy stood quite still submitting his heart to that first quick rending and tearing asunder which is only the initial agony of parting how soon he said without raising his eyes oh he holds on it may be a day or two the boy walked slowly away towards the ridge of the low hill maudie turned and watched him on the top of the divide he stopped looking over whatever it was he saw off there he could not meet it yet he flung himself down with his face in the fire weed and lay there all night long kaviak was sent after him in the morning but only to say \"breakfast maudie s tent \" the boy saw that mac and potts knew for the first time the big chimney men felt a barrier between them and that one who had been the common bond keeping the incongruous allied and friendly only nig ran in and out unchilled by the imminence of the colonel s withdrawal from his kind towards noon the o flynns came up the creek and were stopped near the tent by the others they all stood talking low till a noise of scuffling broke the silence within they drew nearer and heard the colonel telling maudie not to turn out nig and kaviak i like seein my friends where s the boy so they went in did he know he must know or he would have asked o flynn what the devil made him look like that all he said was \"hello how do you do madam \" and he made a weak motion of one hand towards mrs o flynn to do duty for that splendid bow of his then as no one spoke \"you re too late o flynn \" too late had a job in your line then suddenly \"maudie s worth the whole lot of you \" they knew it was his way of saying \"she s told me \" they all sat and looked at the floor nothing happened for a long time at last \"well you all know what my next move is what s yours \" there was another silence but not nearly so long what prospects pardners he repeated the boy looked at maudie she made a little gesture of \"i ve done all the fightin i m good for \" the colonel s eyes clear again and tranquil travelled from face to face o flynn cleared his throat but it was mac who spoke yes a we would like to hold a last hold a counsel o war we ve always kind o followed your notions at least veracity pared down the compliment \"at least you can t say but what we ve always listened to you \" yes you might just a start us as well as you can says potts the colonel smiled a little each man still \"starting\" forever starting for somewhere or something until he should come to this place where the colonel was even he why he was \"starting\" too for him this was no end other than a chapter s ending but these men he had lived and suffered with they all wanted to talk the next move over not his theirs all except the boy it seemed mac was in the act of changing his place to be nearer the colonel when potts adroitly forestalled him the others drew off a little and made desultory talk while potts in an undertone told how he d had a run of bad luck no doubt it would turn but if ever he got enough again to pay his passage home he d put it in the bank and never risk it i swear i wouldn t i ve got to go out in the fall goin to get myself married christmas and if she s willing we ll come up here on the first boat in the spring with backing this time he showed a picture the colonel studied it i believe she ll come he said and potts was so far from clairvoyance that he laughed awkwardly flattered then anxiously \"wish i was sure o my passage money \" when potts before he meant to had yielded place to o flynn the colonel was sworn to secrecy and listened to excited whispers of gold in the sand off yonder on the coast of the behring sea the world in general wouldn t know the authenticity of the new strike till next season he and mrs o flynn would take the first boat sailing out of san francisco in the spring oh you re going outside too in the fahll yes yes ye see i ain t like the rest i ve got mrs o flynn to consider dawson s great but it ain t the place to start a famully where you goin mac said the colonel to the irate one who was making for the door \"i want a little talk with you \" mac turned back and consented to express his opinion of the money there was to be made out of tailings by means of a new hydraulic process he was going to lend kaviak to sister winifred again on the old terms she d take him along when she returned to holy cross and mac would go outside raise a little capital return and make a fortune for the moment he was broke hadn t even passage money did the colonel think he could the colonel seemed absorbed in that eternal interrogation of the tent top mine you know mac drew nearer still and went on in the lowered voice \"mine s a special case a man s bound to do all he can for his boys \" i didn t know you had boys mac jerked \"yes\" with his square head \"bobbie s goin on six now \" the others older others mac stared an instant \"oh there s only one more \" he grinned with embarrassment and hitched his head towards kaviak i guess you ve jawed enough said maudie leaving the others and coming to the foot of the bed and maudie s goin back too said the sick man she nodded and you re never goin to leave her again no maudie s a little bit of all right said the patient the big chimney men assented but with sudden misgiving what was that job ye said ye were wantin me forr oh maudie s got a friend of hers to fix it up fix what up demanded potts little postscript to my will mac jerked his head at the nurse with that clear sight of dying eyes the colonel understood a meaner spirit would have been galled at the part those \"louisville instructions\" had been playing but cheap cynicism was not in the colonel s line he knew the awful pinch of life up here and he thought no less of his comrades for asking that last service of getting them home but it was the day of the final clean up for the colonel he must not leave misapprehension behind i wanted maudie to have my min ok claim got a min ok claim o my own so i ve left it to be divided they all looked up one half to go to a little girl in frisco and the other half well i ve left the other half to kaviak strikes me he ought to have a little piece o the north y yes oh yes good idea mac thought he d go over to the other tent and cook some dinner there was a general movement as they were going out boy \" yes he came back nig followed and the two stood by the camp bed waiting their colonel s orders don t you go wastin any more time huntin gold mines i don t mean to go back to your own work go back to your own people the boy listened and looked away it s good to go pioneering but it s good to go home oh h the face on the pillow was convulsed for that swift passing moment \"best of all to go home and if you leave your home too long your home leaves you \" home doesn t seem so important as it did when i came up here the colonel fastened one hand feverishly on his pardner s arm i ve been afraid of that it s magic break away promise me you ll go back and stay lord lord he laughed feebly \"to think a fella should have to be urged to leave the north alone wonderful place but there s black magic in it or who d ever come who d ever stay \" he looked anxiously into the boy s set face i m not saying the time was wasted he went on \"i reckon it was a good thing you came \" yes it was a good thing i came you ve learned a thing or two several specially on the long trail most of all on the long trail the colonel shut his eyes maudie came and held a cup to his lips thank you i begin to feel a little foggy what was it we learned on the trail pardner but the boy had turned away \"wasn t it didn t we learn how near a tolerable decent man is to bein a villain \" we learned that a man can t be quite a brute as long as he sticks to another man oh was that it in the night maudie went away to sleep the boy watched do you know what i m thinking about the sick man said suddenly about that lady down at home guess again about those fellas at holy cross no i never was as taken up with the jesuits as you were no sah i m thinkin about the czar poor old colonel he was wandering again did i ever tell you i saw him once no did had a good look at him knew a fella in petersburg too that he rested a moment \"that czar s all right only he sends the wrong people to siberia ought to go himself and take his ministers for a winter on the trail \" on his face suddenly the old half smiling half shrewd look \"but lord bless you tisn t only the czar we all have times o thinkin we re some punkins specially kentuckians i reckon most men have their days when they re twelve feet high and wouldn t stoop to say thank ye to a king let em go on the winter trail \" yes agreed the boy \"they d find out \" and he stopped plenty o use for head men though the faint voice rang with an echo of the old authority \"no foolishness but just plain i m the one that s doin the leadin like nig here and it s my business to lick the hind dog if he shirks \" he held out his hand and closed it over his friend s \"i was boss o the big chimney boy but you were boss o the trail \" the colonel was buried in the old moose pasture with people standing by who knew that the world had worn a friendlier face because he had been in it that much was clear even before it was found that he had left to each of the big chimney men five hundred dollars not to be drawn except for the purpose of going home they thought it was the sense of that security that made them put off the day they would \"play the game up to the last moment and see \" september s end brought no great change in fortune but a change withal of deep significance the ice had begun to run in the yukon no man needed telling it would \"be a tuhble wintah and dey d better move down souf \" all the late boats by both routes had been packed those men who had failed and yet most tenacious were hanging on for some last lucky turn of the wheel knew the risk they ran and now to day the final boat of the year was going down the long way to the behring sea and by the canadian route open a little longer the big chimney men by grace of that one left behind would be on the last ship to shoot the rapids in not only to the thousands who were going to those who stayed behind there was something in the leaving of the last boat something that knocked upon the heart they too could still go home they gathered at the docks and told one another they wouldn t leave dawson for fifty thousand dollars then looked at the \"failures\" with home sick eyes remembering those months before the luckiest klondyker could hear from the world outside between now and then what would have come to pass up here and what down there below the boy had got a place for muckluck in the a c store she was handy at repairing and working in fur and said she was \"all right\" on this bright autumn morning when the boy went in to say good bye with a white woman and an indian boy in a little room overlooking the water front muckluck was working in the intervals of watching the crowds on the wharf eyes more experienced than hers might well stare probably in no other place upon the globe was gathered as motley a crew english indian scandinavian french german negroes chinese poles japs finns all the fine gentlemen had escaped by earlier boats all the smart young women with their gold nugget buttons as big as your thumb lucky miners from the creeks with heavy consignments of dust to take home had been too wary to run any risk of the never know what closing inopportunely the great majority here on the wharf dazed or excited lugging miscellaneous possessions things they had clung to in straits so desperate they knew no more how to relax their hold than dead fingers do these were men whose last chance had been the klondyke and who here as elsewhere had failed many who came in young were going out old but the odd thing was that those worst off went out game no whining none of the ostentatious pathos of those broken on the wheel of a great city a man under muckluck s window dressed in a moose skin shirt straw hat broadcloth trousers and carpet slippers in one hand a tin pail in the other something tied in a handkerchief called out lustily to a ragged individual cleaving a way through the throng \"got your stuff aboard \" yes goin to get it off i ain t goin home till next year and the face above the moose skin shirt was stricken with a sudden envy without any telling he knew just how his pardner s heart had failed him when it came to turning his tattered back on the possibilities of the klondyke oh i m comin back soon s i get a grub stake i ain t said another with a dazed expression a klondyker carrying home his frying pan the one thing apparently saved out of the wreck you think you ain t comin back just wait once you ve lived up here the outside ain t good enough fur yer right said an old forty miler \"you can try it but lord how you ll miss this goll darn yukon \" among the hundreds running about talking bustling hauling heterogeneous luggage sending last letters doing last deals a score of women either going by this boat or saying good bye to those who were and potts the o flynns and mac waiting to hand over kaviak to sister winifred the boy at the open window above staring down on the tatterdemalion throng remembered his first meeting with the big chimney men as the washington city steamed out of san francisco s golden gate a year and a month before of course even in default of finding millions something stirring might have happened something heroic rewarding to the spirit if no other how but his own special revelation blurred swamped for the moment in the common wreck he said to himself that nothing of the sort had befallen the big chimney men any more than to the whipped and bankrupt crew struggling down there on the wharf they simply had failed all alike and yet there was between them and the common failures of the world one abiding difference these had greatly dared as long as the meanest in that crowd drew breath and held to memory so long might he remember the brave and terrible days of the klondyke rush and that he had borne in it his heavy share no share in any mine save that the knowledge that he was not among the vast majority who sit dully to the end beside what things they were born to the earnings of other men the savings of other women afraid to go seeking after better lest they lose the good they have they had failed but it could never be said of a klondyker that he had not tried he might in truth look down upon the smug majority that smiles at unusual endeavour unless success excuses crowns it no one there after all so poor but he had one possession treasured among kings and he had risked it what could a man do more good bye muckluck goo bye boat canada way no go till thursday thursday yes he said absently eyes still on the american ship then why you say goo bye to day lot to do i just wanted to make sure you were all right her creamy face was suddenly alight but not with gratitude oh yes all right here she said haughtily \"i not like much the boston men king george men best \" it was so her sore heart abjured her country for among the natives of the klondyke white history stops where it began when george the third was king \"i think\" she shot sideways a shrewd look \"i think i marry a king george man \" and at the prospect her head drooped heavily then you ll want to wear this at your wedding the boy drew his hand out of his pocket threw a walrus string over her bent head and when she could see clear again her katharine medal was swinging below her waist and \"the boston man\" was gone she stared with blinded eyes out of the window till suddenly in the mist one face was clear the boy standing still down there in the hurly burly hands in pockets staring at the ship suddenly sister winifred her black veil swirling in the wind an orderly from st mary s hospital following with a little trunk at the gangway she is stopped by the purser asked some questions smiles at first and shakes her head and then in dismay clasps her hands seeming to plead while the whistle shrieks muckluck turned and flew down the dark little stair threaded her way in and out among the bystanders on the wharf till she reached the sister s side the nun was saying that she not only had no money but that a yukon purser must surely know the sisters were forbidden to carry it he could not doubt but the passage money would be made good when they got to holy cross but the purser was a new man and when mac and others who knew the yukon custom expostulated he hustled them aside and told sister winifred to stand back the gangway was going up it was then the boy came and spoke to the man finally drew out some money and paid the fare the nun not recognising him too bewildered by this rough passage with the world even to thank the stranger stood motionless grasping kaviak s hand two children you would say her long veil blowing hurrying on before her to that haven in the waste the mission at holy cross again the boy was delaying the upward swing of the gangway the nun s trunk must come on board two men rushed for it while he held down the gang mustn t cry he said to muckluck \"you ll see sister winifred again \" not for that i cry ah i never shall have happiness yes that trunk he called in the babel of voices shouting from ship and shore the boy heard princess muckluck saying with catches in her breath i always knew i would get no luck why ah i was a bad child the baddest of all the pymeut children yes yes they ve got it now the boy shouted up to the captain then low and smiling absently \"what did you do that was so bad princess \" me i i mocked at the geese it was the summer they were so late and as they flew past pymeut i yes i mocked at them a swaying and breaking of the crowd the little trunk flung on board the men rushing back to the wharf the gang lifted and the last lower river boat swung out into the ice flecked stream keen to piercing a cry rang out muckluck s stop they carry him off it is meestake oh oh the boy was standing for ard nig beside him o flynn rushed to the wharf s edge and screamed at the captain to stop be the siven mac issued orders most peremptory muckluck wept as excitedly as though there had never been question of the boy s going away but while the noise rose and fell potts drawled a \"guess he means to go that way \" no he don t stop you captain stop your boat well said a bystander \"i never seen any feller as calm as that who was bein took the way he didn t want to go \" d ye mean there s a new strike the suggestion flashed electric through the crowd it was the only possible explanation he knows what he s about lord i wish i d a froze to him yep said buck one \"never seen that young feller when he looked more like he wouldn t give a whoop in hell to change places with anybody \" as o flynn back from his chase hoarse and puffing stopped suddenly be the siven father brachet said the little divil d be coming back to howly cross where s that lower river camp gold there no then you re talking through your hat say potts where in hell is he goin damfino the end end of the project gutenberg ebook
