# detect_narration_and_project_dialogue
Project for AI574

I added the text_to_speech files. In the output_dir there is a sample of a longer piece created using the text files.

You will have to download Coqui-tts for this to work. I cloned the repository then installed it.

I also made a function for overlaying music, but since the music files are too long, I could not upload them to git.
