"You ask first,",Bilbo
"he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle. So Gollum hissed:",Tolkien
"What has roots as nobody sees, Is taller than trees, Up, up it goes, And yet never grows?",Gollum
"Easy!",Bilbo
"said Bilbo.",Tolkien
"Mountain, I suppose.",Bilbo
"Does it guess easy? It must have a competition with us, my preciouss! If precious asks, and it doesn’t answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, and we doesn’t answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We shows it the way out, yes!",Gollum
"All right!",Bilbo
"said Bilbo, not daring to disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to think of riddles that could save him from being eaten.",Tolkien
"Thirty white horses on a red hill, First they champ, Then they stamp, Then they stand still.",Bilbo
"That was all he could think of to ask—the idea of eating was rather on his mind. It was rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you do.",Tolkien
"Chestnuts, chestnuts,",Gollum
"he hissed.",Tolkien
"Teeth! teeth! my preciousss; but we has only six!",Gollum
"Then he asked his second:",Tolkien
"Voiceless it cries, Wingless flutters, Toothless bites, Mouthless mutters.",Gollum
"Half a moment!",Bilbo
"cried Bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably about eating. Fortunately he had once heard something rather like this before, and getting his wits back he thought of the answer.",Tolkien
"Wind, wind of course,",Bilbo
"he said, and he was so pleased that he made up one on the spot.",Tolkien
"This’ll puzzle the nasty little underground creature,",Bilbo
"he thought:",Tolkien
"An eye in a blue face Sawan eye in a green face. That eye is like to this eye, Said the first eye, But in lowplace Not in high place.",Bilbo
"Ss, ss, ss,",Gollum
"said Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was forgetting this sort of thing. But just as Bilbo was beginning to hope that the wretch would not be able to answer, Gollum brought up memories of ages and ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a river,",Tolkien
"Sss, sss, my preciouss,",Gollum
"he said.",Tolkien
"Sun on the daisies it means, it does.",Gollum
