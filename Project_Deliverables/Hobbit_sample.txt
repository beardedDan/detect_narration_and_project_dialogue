“Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green.
But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his
shady hat.
“What do you mean?” he said. “Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning
whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?”

“All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into
the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine! There’s no hurry, we have
all the day before us!” Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a
beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The
Hill.

“Very pretty!” said Gandalf. “But I have no time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am looking
for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it’s very difficult to find anyone.”

“I should think so — in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty
disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can’t think what anybody sees in them,”
said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger
smokering. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice
of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old
man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till
Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.

“Good morning!” he said at last. “We don’t want any adventures here, thank you! You might try
over The Hill or across The Water.” By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.

“What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!” said Gandalf. “Now you mean that you want



to get rid of me, and that it won’t be good till I move off.”

“Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don’t think I know your name?”

“Yes, yes, my dear sir — and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name,
though you don’t remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I
should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took’s son, as if I was selling buttons at the
door!”

“Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of
magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered? Not the fellow
who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of
princesses and the unexpected luck of widows’ sons? Not the man that used to make such particularly
excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer’s Eve. Splendid!
They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all
evening!” You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also
that he was very fond of flowers. “Dear me!” he went on. “Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so
many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees
to visiting elves — or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter — I
mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no
idea you were still in business.”

“Where else should I be?” said the wizard. “All the same I am pleased to find you remember
something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, and that is not without
hope. Indeed for your old grandfather Took’s sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give
you what you asked for.”

“I beg your pardon, I haven’t asked for anything!”

“Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this
adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you — and profitable too, very likely, if you ever get
over it.”

“Sorry! I don’t want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning! But please come to tea
— any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Good bye!” With that the hobbit turned
and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seem rude. Wizards
after all are wizards.

“What on earth did I ask him to tea for!” he said to himself, as he went to the pantry. He had only
just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his
fright.

Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing long but quietly. After a
while he stepped up, and with the spike on his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbit’s beautiful
green front-door. Then he strode away, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake
and beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well.

The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well, unless
he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this: Gandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had
been too flustered to do anything of the kind.

Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and then he remembered!
He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran
to the door.
